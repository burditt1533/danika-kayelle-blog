		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Destiny</span> is the inevitable or necessary fate to which a particular person 0r thing is destined.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose</span> is the reason for which something's is done or created or for which something exists.

A <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Gift</span> is a notable capacity, talent, or endowment; something voluntarily transferred by one person to another without compensation.

You see, everyone was created with a purposed gift to bring about their destiny.

Destiny is inevitable. It is a necessary fate. In other words, destiny is something you cannot escape. Whatever God has for you is for you. You can't change that, give it back, nor negotiate that. And better yet, can't no man take that from you. If you are a child of God, you were preDESTINED, you were called, you were justified, and you were glorified. (Romans 8: 29-30). So don't be afraid or run from your destiny. It's yours for the taking. You were called for that, you were justified for that, and God has glorified you to do that. So do it!

Purpose is the reason something was done or created. God creating you was not a mistake, no matter what your mom or dad has said. You were DESTINED to be created. Embrace it. You were PURPOSELY created. Everything and everyone has a purpose. So really and truly, there are no mistakes. But in all honesty, God loves "mistakes" It doesn't say that He heals the non-broken, He heals the broken, He heals the sick! Jesus tell us in Matthews 11:28-29 (KJV) Come unto me all ye that labour and are heave laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. He don't ask for people that "got it all together" to come to Him. He don't need you. You got it, so what is it that He can do for you?? That's why I believe God chooses the "mistaken", the broken hearted, the ones with a past, the ones who were told they will never amount to anything, those that were tore down by the ones that should have been lifting them up, those that was told they are going to end up either dead or in jail. THOSE are the ones that shine brighter than those always seen. If all dogs can bark, then no one will be surprised at the next dog that barks, but now if dog meows, then that dog is more likely to turn more heads than the "normal" dog. Can we all say that often times its best to be different!? Why be the same??? Especially if everybody are doing the same things!?

A gift is a notable capacity, talent, OR endowment. So don't think just because you can't sing, dance, write, or what have you that God made you giftless. The conjunction "or"  is used to connect words, phrases, or clauses representing alternatives or used in correlation. Meaning, in order to be considered having a gift does not requires you having all three. If that was the case, there would have been "and" where the "or" was placed. You don't necessarily have to have a "talent" to bless God and others with your gift. For instance, notable capacity. Your gift could be the ability or power to do, experience, or understand something worthy of attention or notice; to recognize something in somebody to focus on to help bring out the good and better in them or to realize that someone is hurting on the inside even when they are smiling on the outside. Being that person to lend a listening ear to those with a battered and broken heart that needs to speak. Or, on the other hand, you may not be a really good listener, nor do you have talent, but The Lord has blessed you with financial blessings. That's where endowment comes into place. Your gift can be simply purchasing books for the not so privilege child who is determined to bettering him/herself but the world or "system" seems to be against them and even though they are trying and doing the right things, they still fall short, or if you can't cook, it can be purchasing can goods and/or non perishable items to give to the needy and homeless. A gift is so wide range and I think that's where a lot of us gets confused, scared, or nervous about. Your gift may not be as "flashy", "extravagant", or whatevs as the next, but your gift is your gift! Not to compare to others, but to share with others. 1 Corinthians 12:4 (KJV) says: Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. 1  Corinthians 7:7 (NET) says: I wish that everyone was as I am. But each has his own gift from God, one this way, another that. And then Roman 6:12 (KJV) says: Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith. From all three of these verses, we can see that everyone has their own gift and Romans tells us to act accordingly to those gifts to the proportion of our faith. Meaning, your gifts will and shall reflect your faith. If you don't have faith that if you sow bountifully then you shall reap bountifully, then 9xs out of 10, your gift wont be of monetary things. But 1Peter 4:10-11 tells us to use our gifts to serve one another as good stewards of the varied grace of God. V11 (NET): Whosever speaks, let it be with God's word. Whoever serves, do so with the strength that God supplies so that in everything God will be glorified through Jesus Christ... So at the end of it all, your gift is not to reap manly blessing, or to glorify man and/or uplift yourself, but they are to serve one another and to glorify The Father. It's not about you, but its about Jesus. Romans 12:3 (KJV) tells us: For I say through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly the he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith. In other words, yes, think highly of yourself, be confident in your gifts and your works, but don't pat yourself too hard on the back for God has only given you what's equivalent to your faith. So I ask you, what is your faith level?!

Now, I know I spent a lot of time going in on gifts because I feel that's the thing that's hindering some us from realizing our purpose and going into our destiny. You see, I been knew I had the gift of words since a child, but I never was fully comfortable in it because I felt I wasn't as advanced as the next person who wrote poetry and I was as brave as the next person to share my words with others outside of my inner circle or those who I wrote pieces about or for. And then, I wasn't really saved, even though I was baptized (yes, there is a difference), nor living right at all to fully use my gift or to know that the purpose of my gift was for my destiny. But don't get me wrong, I am no where, shape, or form living completely right, and none of us ever will, but the difference now from then is when I slip up (and I do, I'm human), I go to God and admit my wrong(s), and wholeheartedly, not only ask for forgiveness, but repent (there is a difference), and move forward and not stay or dwell on that mistake. Therefore my spirit gets renewed and the conviction and guilt be removed; but that's a whole nother blog for a totally different day. I am now to the point where I am ready to accept my gift, embrace my purpose, and work towards my destiny. After being told many, many times, by multiple different people, and receiving tons of confirmations over the last couple of days this blog was created. I don't know what its going to do, where its going to go, or how it will be perceived or accepted, but what I do know that I am not doing it for me, those who told me I just need to go on ahead and start blogging, but I am doing it for Him. Also, I pray that this can reach, help, or touch somebody; whether its to confirm something they already knew, open their eyes to realize and see their gifts, purpose, and destiny, or touch them enough to decide its time to change and use their gifts for good rather than evil. As Philippians 4:17 (NET) says: I do not say this because I am seeking a gift. Rather, I seek the credit that abounds to your account. I don't want any "amen"s or pats on the back for this; what I want is to use my gift and my story to glorify God and to motivate and uplift others so that they may prosper and grow and bless others.

So, with that being said.....This is my gift from God to you.

For me to read how a gift really can be versus what I thought it was in my mind this makes sense to me. I believe I know what my gift is now.

		<title>Kiss my Awesome, Sweet Self!</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This morning when I got up, I was prepared to write something else and I heard something say, "Kiss my aye.es.es.".. I was like, "whaaaat"..and it said, "Kiss my Awesome, Sweet Self".. All I could do was laugh and say, "My God is a fool", and then I thought to myself, "My God IS Awesome, He IS Sweet"; then a light in my head went off and was like, "Blog about me" and now here I am!

Have you every really sat back and realized how awesome God is? How sweet He is?? Let's think about it.

How awesome is it that we have NO clue how or who created God but He created all these things??!? He created the tiny little ant to the tallest tree in the forest and everything in between. He created the Heavens and the Earth. He created man and woman. Simply from speaking a word and from dust. How awesome is that?! All throughout the Old Testament it talks about how awesome God is. I love what it says in Deuteronomy 10:16-18 and 21: (NET) <em>Therefore cleanse your heart and stop being so stubborn! For the Lord your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great, mighty, and AWESOME God who is unbiased and takes no bribe, who justly treats the orphan and widow, and who loves resident foreigners, giving them food and clothing. V21</em>:<em> He is the one you should praise; He is your God, the one who has done these great and AWESOME things for you that you have seen.</em> Out of all the verses, this one stood out to me the most because I remember one day questioning myself and Him for that matter, like, "Man! God tells us not to boast ourselves or like, do things not for praise or glory and yet He wants us to sit here and give him ALL the praise and ALL the glory, He is something else!" [Being stubborn right?!] Now when I tell you, the Holy Spirit slapped me SO hard and was like "Really Danika!? How DARE you ask a question like that?! If you wake grateful and ungrateful people up EVERY day, heal the sick, give people what they want knowing they are only gonna take the shine for themselves and forget all about you, and many, many more things out the kindness of your heart, you wouldn't want or ask for anything in return??" And that's true. God asks nothing from us in return BUT to give Him the honor, praise, and glory. I mean, that's all we really CAN do. He has everything, He IS everything. So what can you give a person who has everything?? Nothing! But gratitude, recognition, and praise. I wrote about this before: In Deut 8:11-20 (NET) it tells us not to forget the Lord by not keeping his commandments, ordinances, and statutes and forgetting that it was HE who brought us from slavery and when we get all of these blessings to (V17) <em>Be careful not to say, "My own ability and skill have gotten me this wealth"</em>. We must remember that He is the one who gives US the ability TO get wealth, and if we follow Him, He will fulfill His promises He gave to our ancestors many, many years ago (because He is a man of His word--unlike us humans), but if we do forget and follow other gods (wealth, power, greed, selfishness, gluttony; just to name a few), just like the many blessings He has gave us, He will surely destroy them and/or take them away because of our disobedience. And I can attest to that! I remember at one particular job I was making decent money (at that time) and was like, "oh yeah, I got it going on".. Well baby, let me tell you.. That job gave me SO many problems and I couldn't "save" like I was planning on and talking about doing because things just kept on popping up that I HAD to take care of! I wasn't tithing or anything either, giving NO reverence to God, needless to say that job diminished right in front of my very eyes. Smh..

But back to the subject at hand. There's this song I just absolutely LOVE called "My God is Awesome" by Charles Jenkins. Very few words, yet so, so meaningful. Not only does it tells how awesome He is, but is shows how sweet He is. God is probably thee sweetest person we will EVER meet and/or know. He doesn't want to see ANY of His children hurt, broken, in bondage, in pain, living below His means, etc. He wants the very best for us. He wants to protect us, heal us when we are broken, strengthen where we're weaken, forgive us and set us free, and for us to live more abundantly! Above all, I think the most awesomely sweetest thing He has done for ALL of us, saved and unsaved, was sending His ONLY begotten Son to die for our sins. If that's not an ultimate sacrifice then I don't know what is!! Being as God is omniscient, all-knowing, He knew there would still be folks against Him and running with the devil, and yet, He STILL allowed the humiliation, ridicules, beatings, taunting, and crucifixion to happen. That alone just makes my heart cringe and smile all at the same time. Knowing that when I was yet a sinner, God still smiled and had His hands upon me. That's just so sweet...and so awesome! Man, God is Good! (Nobody's background is squeaky clean, so let's not get it twisted folks!)

Self. Well, He is who He is. He is Himself. Always has been, is now, and always will be. There is none like Him. Hebrews 13:8 (KJV) <em>Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and for ever.</em> He ain't changing and that's what makes Him so AWESOME!!! So go on ahead and reflect and don't forget to give God His props and thank Him for the many, many things He has blessed you with!! :)

Thank you Jesus!! Smooches!!!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Ok, so I just took myself out on a movie date. I saw Lee Daniel's "The Butler". I won't comment on the movie, but I'm probably not with the majority on that one. Anywho, as I'm driving home, jamming to my lil CD, the song "It's not over (When God is in it)" by Isreal &amp; New Breed...and as I'm driving, I just get hit with a whole bunch of emotions. I start thinking about my grandfather and how much I miss him (he passed away 7/2/13) and then the tears started welling up in my eyes, and I'm like, "I'm not gon cry, I'm not gon cry" and as I'm saying that to myself and the song playing "its not over, its not over" I just start boohooing!!! Aaaaaah!! I wasn't all hyperventilating and snotting and things, but the tears just wouldn't stop falling! I mean, good thing I was doing the speed limit and was in the slow lane. Yeesh! But I just start thinking about how much I miss my grandfather and how he's not gonna be here for my wedding day (claiming it) and to see my children he was begging me for before he passed and witnessing me obtain my Masters and my relationship with God blossoms, and so many other things and it just brought tears to my eyes, and is bringing tears to my eyes now! Then, as I'm thinking bout that I realized the movie may have affected me more than I thought and the song was just a confirmation of it all. It's not over. We, as blacks or coloreds or what have you, fought, been through, and overcame SO much! And for a second, it's pretty normal to be biased, but it got me thinking, if other races, nationalities, or ethnicities were getting so much media like Blacks, will we see all the things that goes on with them?? I mean, I'm sure there's some struggles, discriminations, and things amongst them as well!? We all are fighting for something! We're all living, hoping, dreaming, wishing, and praying to achieve something and to reach our full potential (or so I would hope) and I am here to tell you that it is not over! I know me grieving over my grandfather is not over. I may not cry all the time and be able to smile a little more, but its still gonna be there. And that's fine! He was a good man.. But nevertheless, its not over. Life is not over, we still gotta live and keep on moving. That song, and  yes, its pretty long, just gave me even more confirmation on my life and inspired me to write and encourage someone. Whatever the situation is, whatever the problem, issue, or complication is, it is not over hun. When God is in it and it is to His glory, please believe that it will prosper. I remember my Pastor, Tracy Casby, Sr., once stating, "Don't let fear paint you a vision" and "Don't live in a dream but in faith. A dream only lasts while you are sleeping". I should take my own word with that whole fear phrase...my shyness/stage fright is REAL, blah...but really, if you are a child of God and have faith that through Him all things are possible, then what looks like it's going to fail or you are never gonna get out of a situation or predicament that you are in, let me tell you that it is not over until God says it is. This is only a season and seasons MUST past! Have a great night and be blessed!!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I woke up with this heavy on my heart. A lot of things we believe and want Jesus to do for us, are mostly all impossible and only He can do them! The Bible tells us in Matthews 21:22 (KJV) <em>And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive. </em>Now, as humans, that is quite hard for us to do. We have the mindset of "show me and I'll believe" and a lot of people in the Bible had that mindset also. God did prove Himself to be in a lot of instances. Matthews 9: 28-30 (NET) <em>When He went into the house, the blind men came to Him. Jesus said to them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" They said to Him, "Yes, Lord". Then He touched their eyes saying, "Let it be done for you according to your<span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong> faith</strong></span>. And their eyes were opened...". </em>The impossible. You see, it was a simple question, a simple answer, a simple task for Jesus to do. Now, I know He could have just touched them without asking if they believed and healed them, but Jesus didn't operate like that. He knew who He was, He wanted and needed the people to know for themselves who He was and who He is. [We as His people need faith!] He didn't have anything to prove, He placed people's healing into their own hands. And you know something, I kind of like that about Jesus. Even when a person came to ask Him a question, He turned it around, spoke a parable, and made them see and answer it for themselves. Believe it or not, Jesus was a simple man. We pretty much make Him complicated.

Now! Here's the kicker!! V21 does not say WHEN we shall receive it, but it says we shall receive. So! Just because it does not happen right when you pray about it does not mean it wont happen at all. Habakkuk 2:3 (KJV) says<em>: For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it, because it will surely come, it will not tarry</em>. In other words, He knows everything right? So He knows what it is that you will be praying for, okay. So the vision is for an appointed time, and at the end of that time, it will give a result, a testimony, that even if you wanted to, it could not be a lie, and even though it may take a while, you just wait, (and if you believe), it will come and be right on time! Ha! You see, I think God does this because He knows how we  operate. I know there were times when I prayed for God to get me out of a certain situation, take some things from me, heal me from  some other things, and He came thru! Rather quickly on some things, and what did I turn around and do?! Praise and thank Him in that moment and went right on ahead bringing myself back into that same situation/predicament. Some things are gonna come or happen before other things, but please don't get discouraged. God works on His own time, always have and always will. We could ask and tell Him a specific time frame and believe on it, but that doesn't mean He will give us that. He knows what He's doing. He's making us wait because it may be something we need to see in the process, grow, do, or work on in that process. If patience not one of your strong points, I'm more than sure He wont snap His fingers and give to you today! God truly gives the hardest battles to His strongest people. And normally, those are the people who feel they are too weak to take on the task. But trust God, He knows what He's doing. I believe that He does everything for a reason. If you don't know what that reason is, go to Him with a sincere heart and ask Him to show you. Maybe the reason is to strengthen your relationship with Him, or to finally see and accept Him as Lord and Savior. At those times when He was coming through for me so rapidly, He was also knocking at my heart. But clearly at those times, I wasn't ready to fully give it to Him. So I ask you, what it is that you are asking God to do? Do you truly believe it will come to pass or you say it with your heart, but doubt it in your head??? <em>But he must ask in faith without doubting, for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed around by the wind. For that person must not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord, since he is a double-minded individual, unstable in all his ways.</em> James 1:6-8 (NET)

Don't miss out on your blessing(s) trying to rush through your lesson(s).

"(Job said) He may not come when you want Him, but He'll be there right on time. He's an on time God, yes He is". Dottie Peoples' song: "He's an on time God"

Be blessed..

I love your faith!!!

Also, you know what'll be kool, if you did like a Throwback Thursday each week (or transformation Tuesday or some stuff) directing a post of each of your old posts.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So much, I don't even know where to begin. Every morning I'm just bombarding with thoughts. This particular morning, I woke up thinking about Jesus and His disciples. Now, I won't front like I know them like the back of my hands because I don't but what I DO know is that they were ordinary men and one was a tax collector who I believed was hated by the Jews. I like how this online article I ran across by Mary Fairchild talks about the disciples. She says, "Interestingly, not one of the chosen 12 disciples was a scholar or rabbi. They had no extraordinary skills. Neither religious, nor refined, they were ordinary people, just like you and me. But God chose them for a purpose—to fan the flames of the gospel that would spread across the face of the earth and continue to burn down through the centuries. He selected and used each of these regular guys to carry out his exceptional plan". Awesome right!? So thinking about the disciples got me to thinking about me and messages over the time I have received on how positive I am, or how I inspire people and how much people are proud of me and my "new change of life". It shocking! No lie.. Sometimes I still sit back and wonder "Why me"? Like I wasn't a bad person or really lived a bad life, but the way I was living and things I was doing were none of Him and yet He still saw fit! [And I still mess up and am far from perfect!] Guess that just means that its time for me to stop questioning. You see, God knows what He is doing and who He will be using and how. Its always people you least expect. I know I stated in my first post: "Destiny. Purpose. What is it? What's my gift?" about how God uses and loves the brokenhearted. These 12 ordinary guys with no bomb diggity background went around doing the works of God. They dropped everything and lived, followed, and obeyed strictly off of faith! Yes, sometimes they did question (so nothing's wrong with that), but most of all, regardless of the outcome, THEY STILL DID!! How many of us can say that!?

Anywho, I feel myself getting off subject. So! A couple scriptures comes to mind regarding this topic. Luke 6: 27-28 (KJV): "<em>But I say unto you which hear. Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you. Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you</em>", Romans 12:15 (KJV) "<em>Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep</em>", John 13: 34-35 (KJV) "<em>A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye  have love one to another</em>". You never know who you will need or who will need you. That's why its best to never "burn bridges". It's so hard to love your enemies, turn the other cheek, rejoice with those who are doing well and you're doing not so well, and loving everyone when so many people are totally not loveable!! But guess what!!?!?! Jesus had a whole traitor following Him who released Him to the hands of His killers and what He did!? He loved him, blessed him, prayed for and with him, rejoiced with him, mourned with him and whatever else. He let it be known that He knew about "Judas", but He didn't call no names or anything. You know good and well, we would have been like, "A traitor is amongst us, JUDAS" and put Him all out on blast! But no-no!! We are not to do that. God handles our lightweight. Love everybody, speak to a stranger you're passing up on the street, give a "bum" a dollar. You just never know who or where YOUR next blessing will come from!

Each day we should be thriving to be more like Christ. Don't worry bout your past, the Bible says "<em>Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new</em>." 2 Corinthians 5:17 (KJV) Learn to let things go. That same person that you can't stand because this reason or that reason could just so happen be the thing stopping you not only from getting into Heaven, but from receiving many, if not all of your blessings!! Jesus didn't say you have to be best friends with everyone, He said to love one another and guess what!? You can love from a far!! Say whaaaaat!?!?!? My Pastor always say he doesn't hold anyone in his heart so I am here to tell you.. Don't hold anyone in your heart BUT have Jesus in your heart and be blessed!!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So yesterday evening as I was walking to class, this random dude asked me what was wrong with me and I was like, "nothing", because really, I was having a great day! He said he asked because it looked like I had "something on my mind" and if he was timid, he would not have said anything and it lead me to thinking, and now I'm here blogging. How do you look when you think other people are not around or looking??? Obviously, there are people watching; eyes are everywhere. Now, I don't know ANYONE who are like all smiles 24/7, but are you totally unapproachable?? Jesus was approachable every second of the day. People who no one else wanted to be bothered with and everyone judged even felt He was welcoming. As a Christian, are you welcoming to the "outside world" or you're so high and mighty that only those of "your kind" can approach you?

Now me, I say that I don't like people [working on it], but in reality, I am a people person, and crazy as that is, a lot of random people do come and approach me. Yeah, sometimes in my head, I'm like, "why is this person talking to me", but then I have to think....What if Jesus thought like that? It should be a daily desire to be more Christ like each day He bless you with another opportunity to see life. Is it easy?? Well, nah...not at all!! There's always "running late", "traffic", "person cutting you off", "oversleeping", "no milk", "can't find your keys", "kids are screaming", "accidents", or whatever else stumbling block there is to ruin your morning, WHICH sets the course of your day. But my dear, you have OPTIONS!!! Yeaaaaah!!! Options are good....some of the time. Here, you have the option to let it ruin your day and you have that look on your face that if somebody looks like they have a smile on their face you're going to slap them silly, OR you have the option to say, "You know what, I am going to brush that off and start having a great day now!" Truth be told, it will be much more easier and pleasant to go on ahead and brush that off. Everyone has their good and bad days. My good outweighs my bad and I believe realizing that makes it much more easier for me to brush things off.

We all have our seasons, no one is exempt. But the great thing about seasons are they are only temporary. That's awesome!! Seasons in this instance can correlate with emotions and feelings. Most of the time, that stuff is temporary. Hunger, thirst, like, lust, anger, depression...temporary, for the most part. Tricky thing is what and how do you feed those seasons??? You feed hunger and thirst and you're no longer hungry or thirsty. Feed like...may grow in to love. Feed lust, well....that never really turned out good for me, neither has feeding anger and/or depression. {And I was feeding that with alcohol mainly. But anywho!} Options, decisions....God has control, be He gives those things to us. Choose wisely.
<p style="text-align: left">So now, think about it. On the inside (as Christians), you should be filled with The Spirit, which should be glowing on the outside, right?? What is dimming your light?? If strangers were mirrors, would you like what you see in them??? I do believe that this is what gives Christians a bad name or have people looking at a lot of folks with the side eye when they claim to be a "child of God". A tree is known by the fruits it produce (Matthews 12:33 (NET): "<em>Make a tree good and its fruit will be good, or make a tree bad and its fruit will be bad, for a tree is known by its fruits</em>"). I'm sorry, but you can't be no child of God tearing down the next person, judging, or claiming to be perfect and sinless, REGARDLESS of how often you go to church or how many scriptures you can quote or call out! Just how you have access to those things, so does the devil. Please believe. I been wanting to blog about the different types of "folk" there is out there, but haven't got my full confirmation for it and I try not to write until I do so that it can all come together and hopefully be able to confirm something in someone else, but its gonna come because I believe that there is a lot of "church folk" out there which gives "real Christian folk" a bad name and turn a lot of people away from God and the truth. That still brings me to what I am talking about here though. How are you being portrayed?? People are watching....are you a pleasant or unpleasant sight?? Are you approachable or run people away?? How do you walk, or as my Pastor would say/ask, "How you livin'"?!</p>
<p style="text-align: left">{{{Check out Ephesians chapter 5}}}</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Toodles!!</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Awe man!! So much I want to blog about!!!!!! This has been a very tremendous week! Out of all the events that took place, one particular thing stood out. This morning as I was getting ready for work, I was reflecting on the past days. Now, I've always been pretty close to my family and things, but when my grandfather took sick, I was a sleep in at my grandmother's house and then when he passed away, I just pretty much moved in. I don't think my grandmother is like any other grandmother. I'm inside more than her, but she's so cool, down to earth, and humble. Her and my grandfather used to go out to eat on Thursdays and I basically keep up the tradition. Thursday past (yesterday) was VERY insightful!! We shared laughs, stories, and advice. So this morning as I'm giving thanks to God; it just hit me. Like I am SO grateful to have my grandmother in my life and I wish that she and I were spending this time together prior to why we do it now. Titus 2: 3-5 popped up in mind (NET) <em>"Older women likewise are to exhibit behavior fitting for those who are holy, not slandering, not slaves to excessive drinking, but teaching what is good. In this way they will train the younger women to love their husbands, to love their children, to be self-controlled, pure, fulfilling their duties at home, kind, being subject to their own husbands, so that the message of God may not be discredited". </em>These are the things that she was pretty much teaching me and telling me about. I am no feminist or what have you, but I do believe that as women, we really have and hold much more power than we think! I believe that since Eve was the first to take bite of the fruit, people just automatically equate that with women being weak. But if you look closer in to it, Satan went to Eve because she was the stronger one, and he knew once he broke through to her, that he could get to Adam. And not to mention, it is called "the fall of man" not "the fall of Eve or Adam". Anywho! All throughout the Bible there are stories of many, many great women making sacrifices and having authority. When I read about or hear stories about some of the sacrifices that the women made it makes me think about the ultimate sacrifice Jesus made. WOMEN ARE POWERFUL!

So women, I truly encourage you to take a look inside yourself and see your true beauty. For so long we have be downplayed, misused, abused, and mistreated by quite a few people we "loved" I'm sure. But in reality, we are here to uplift, love, nurture, and care for others. We are "helpmeet" to man. Not equal to man to be in competition with, but to help him accomplish what it is that he is set out to accomplished. Through women, men and others are blessed. Helping others is how we are blessed. Now, I am in no way, shape, or form saying to go out there being a "duck" for every guy you meet! There is ONE guy for you. But what if you passed your "one guy" limit?? Sweetie, if you're not married to the RIGHT man, then you have not passed it up. It is not too late to get yourself on the right path. So what? You didn't save yourself until marriage from the very beginning. I am here to tell you the beginning is NOW! Make it up in your mind to become a better you, a woman of God, a woman of Virtue, fearfully and wonderfully made, a Proverbs 31 woman!! It's never too late to start over new. Yeah, so what!? You had a past. We all did! But when I tell you repentance is one great of a thing. God washes your slate CLEAN.... The old you is no more!! Once you set in your mind that you are more, you need and deserve more, God will open so many doors for you. You will easily see who's there for you and who's not. Who you are to help and who you are to flee from. When you transform, you're gonna rub your eyes and be like, "Man! This is what I've been missing?!" So many people will respect you. Regardless if they agree with your decision, new lifestyle, or what have you. You are going to have such a new glow and demeanor about yourself its crazy!! Oh, but it will get trying!! Going from what your knew to something new will always be a challenge, but each obstacle you overcome, the stronger you will be and the deeper your faith will get. You are going to see and realize so much for and about yourself that settling will NEVER be an option again! God wants all of His children to have the very best. Now that I'm "pure" I'm starting to realize WHY He wants each and everyone of us to be so until marriage. Sex/lust with someone that's not for you will open lots of gateways for so many things to come in and play against you. It'll have you feeling things that's not true, do things that's not you, questioning every little thing that goes on or happen, and leave you alone and broken hearted. God created sex to be a beautiful thing. Something for one man and one woman to enjoy. In all honesty, I'm looking for to after saying  "I do" to get it on and popping! I can only imagine how amazing that connection will be!! Man!!! Off subject...let me get back!

I didn't even want to talk about sex and saving yourself, I wanted to talk about having an older woman as an influence in your life. It may not be a relative, it could be a teacher, an elder, someone else's mother, cousin, grandmother, whomever! But it should be someone. Someone you can see the fruits of their labor. My grandmother was definitely a helpmeet for my grandfather. She didn't work a day in her life for man, but she worked for her man if you get my drift. My grandfather took care of her and she took care of the house and kids. (Proverbs 31). She practiced submission and yet, still had authority. She stroked his ego and let him know he was loved and appreciated. She let him be a man, thee man, the head of their house! She was always presentable when she went out because she knew who and what she represented. Now that I have new eyes, she is truly an inspiration to me. And in my single days, I am still working on transforming my mind and breaking old and bad strongholds the past had (past tense..claiming it!) on me! I am striving to be that Proverbs 31 woman and when God sees fit to send me my "Adam" [Boaz], man, HUSBAND, I want to be fully prepared and aware of what it is that I need to do! And being as I don't believe in divorce, I trust God that when dude puts a ring on this here ring finger of mine that that will be it. There will be no "ifs, ands, or buts" about it, but "where do I sign"!!?!

It's time that we, women, take back control and go out and do what it is that we were created and set out to do. Quit letting a man run you down and allow God to lift you up and fill that void you're trying to fill with man. Can't nobody fill it but Him. Stop wearing yourself thin and beating yourself up. You are much more than a female dog and what's between your legs. The generational curses stops with YOU!! Be an example. Yield towards "older women" and yield to become someone else's "older woman"!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well, for folks who are close around me have heard and known that I've been TWEAKING to write a blog about "Church folk" and other folks but I've never received my confirmation to do so. I figured out why that was so. I was trying to go about blogging it the wrong way. In my head, it looked like it was going to be like a "calling out" type thing and that's not how I want to come of or portray my blogging to be. So I was told to just share my experience and opinions on it and here it is...

I grew up in a church. My grandfather made sure we were there every Sunday and Tuesdays for Bible Study. Now as kids, you really have no choice to do so. So yeah, I went...faithfully! Especially since we went to McDonald's immediately following! But as I got older and was able to make my own decisions, I started viewing church differently. I knew right from wrong, believed there was a God, and that Jesus died and rose up again for our sins. I knew about asking for forgiveness and all that jazz. Now, even though I knew all of that, I still chose to do my own thing. When I felt I did REALLY bad, I would be like "Man! I need to go to church" or quickly say "God forgive me" or when I remembered to pray, I would make sure before I say "Amen" to ask for forgiveness. That lifestyle became routine or like a norm to me because I've experience FIRST hand people who went to church FAITHFULLY, praising, screaming, hollering, and everything and in the next breath cursing folk out, talking bout what such and such had on at church, or how much such and such ain't no good, they wrong for coming to church knowing God knows what their doing, sloppy drunk, fornicating, committing adultery, and so on and so forth. So naturally, I'm like, "Man, all this is just a show!" But in reality, something in me just felt like that wasn't right and every time that would happen, I would shake my head and be like, "this can't be right". So at one point, I went shop around. I went to visit quite a few different churches: Full Gospel, Jehovah Witness, Pentecostal, Catholic, and other Baptist churches...and believe it or not, I was seeing the SAME thing there!!! So I was like, "What they hay, I might as well stay where I'm at". But as time went by, I was just totally unhappy. Filling voids almost every which way I could, yet nothing sufficed. I remember "I need to find a real good church home" being said over and over and my head and sure enough, one day, I was introduced to it! I will never forget that day, in Dillard's lingerie dept. dressing room, back in 2008 I believe, when a Sister from my church where I am now (Full Life Faith Ministries) came in and all of a sudden started fellowshipping with me. She said she felt it in her Spirit to pray for me, and I allowed her to do so, and she then invited me to her church. I went, and at that time, we were having church outside! Rain, heat, cold, WHATEVER, it was happening. It was a TOTALLY different atmosphere from what I was used to: speaking in tongues, crying, radical praising, etc. The way Pastor spoke and still speak is just SO real. He shows he's human and that he's flawed and teaches strictly on and from the Bible. Not no man made laws and rules, but those only of and from God!! Now, I don't know anyone who can't appreciate that. Hebrews 13:9 (NET) says: "<em>Do not be carried away by all sorts of strange teaching. For it is good for the heart to be strengthened by grace, not ritual meals, which have never benefited those who participated in them"</em>. Don't flee from where you just may need to be just because it's different from where you came... You're leaving that place for a reason right???

So let me go on ahead and clear this out now! I do NOT in no way, shape, or form think that my church is the best church in the whole wide world and that everyone should belong to it because its the realist! NO! But for ME, it is!! It is where The Lord placed me to be. And He has a place for you, but it takes YOU to go out and seek it. When people invite you to church, go on ahead and accept that invitation. You designate your time to everything else, what's an hour or two for God. He allows you to have the rest of the day to do whatever (besides sinning). I remember my Pastor saying at the last Bible Study (Wed nights for 7pm) that if you're in a church where you think all they want is your money (they have those), you need to leave or be delivered. If you don't believe in your leader, you won't grow or be blessed and you don't need to be under them. He also mentioned that there has to be proof of your ministry, life changing proof. And I believe that's the difference. The Bible says in Hebrews 13:7 (KJV) "<em>Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation</em>". In other words, your leader should be producing proof of his ministry. There should be some type of growth and change amongst his people. I can attest that my life has changed tremendously since rejoining my church. Didn't go into detail about the first time, but long story short, I allowed someone to turn me away from the church because of their actions, which brings me to this.

There is no "perfect" church where EVERYone is a SAINT! In all honesty, there's always going to be somebody in the church who are just playing or that you know who just not no good. But its not about them, it is about you! You are accountable for your own works/words/deeds. 2 Corinthians 5:10 (KJV) "<em>For we must appear before the judgment seat of Christ: that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad</em>". Rebecca Sue May can't stand before God on my behalf. God is going to politely (or not so politely) shut that down and say, "Danika...this is all about you sweetheart and what you have done with your life", whether I know Him or not. That verse says "every one" not "just the saved ones" or "only those in the church", but EVERY one. Sinner, saint, whore, pimp, good person, bad person, wicked person, drug addict, drug dealer, murderer, thief, Pastor, Deacon, Usher, Member, atheist, Non-denomination, Baptist, Catholic, Muslim, Democrat, Republic, White, Orange, Norwegian, Black, Mulatto, rich, poor, sick, whatEVER, you WILL be judged!! Your body will go back to where it came as will your spirit and soul. Ecclesiastes 12: 7 (KJV) "<em>Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it</em>".

Lastly, I just want to say that no, I do not believe that the only way you will get to Heaven is by going to church, but is it by Jesus Christ (John 14:6). Truth be told, The Lord comes on a Sunday morning to take His people, I truly believe that a lot of churches will still be full: Pastors, Bishops, Preachers, and all. What I do believe and can testify is that church serves as (some folks heard this before) a gas station. Yes, you should know God on your own, outside of church, pastors, or whom/whatever. Its a personal relationship that no one else can have like you because it is specifically designed for you and Him, but church should be to refill/refuel you. Church should be a place where you get confirmations and convictions about things God has for you, placed on you, or you guys talked about. If your spirit is not getting fed, just like the body, it weakens and then you lose sight.

My prayer is that everyone who is seeking a relationship with God and to better themselves and their lives find the right place for them, under the right leadership ordained by God, to teach them and mold them to be better Christians and people. And hey! If you're content where you are and the way your life is going, I am in NO way to judge, do you boo boo! Be the best whatever you can be. Whether its sinner, drinker, smoker, fornicator, atheist, saint, whatever, be the best "that" you can be. Just don't be a hypocrite. Man up and own up to your stuff. Don't go and blame Jesus for something you clearly did on your own. He gives us the right to make our own decisions. He don't force Himself on us. Revelation 3:20 (NET) "<em>Listen! I am standing at the door and knocking! If anyone hears my voice and opens the door I will come into his home and share a meal with him, and he with me</em>". Right there, its letting you know how He is. He is going to knock and IF anyone hears and open will He come in. The choice is yours. He don't force Himself on anyone...and with that being said, CHRISTIANS, let us not force God and/or church on people. But as stated today in church, you cannot be a dictator, instead, be an example and people will follow. That's my nightly prayer, to be an example and influence to draw people closer to God through my ways, actions, decisions, and faith.

Amen.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Dear friends,

This may be the most hardest, yet cleaning blog I will ever post. What I'm going to do here is call myself out and set a mirror in my face and tell my self off! You see, this past week, I've been reading other blogs, talking and sharing with friends, and just on yesterday, I'm giving advice to someone to let "it" out. And you know how they say, "people can give advice but can't take their own"... I'm gonna attempt to take my own.. So buckle up your seatbelts my dear friends...the journey shall begin.

Everyone has a story and all of them are different, yet most of them are the same. The thing is, no one wants to share their story. Whether it's because of embarrassment, they're scared, or straight up judgment. When people know the truth about you, there's always gonna be a "let me tell you"..but you don't do it for them, you share for the "I needed to hear this". Since darn near the whole world likes to be silent, you never know who needs to hear your story or who you will affect! I can tell you first hand, from being the queen of repressed memory, that I thoroughly enjoy hearing and reading other people's story. I admire their bravery for sharing and I won't lie, sometimes, no judgment at all, I see that my tale is not always as bad as I make it seems. It is a true fact that their is somebody who always has, have, or had it worst than you. And guess what!? You're included in that too! So don't think your life is always above another's cuz it's not. You're "horrible" situation, shines light on another's situation.

Hmmm, so let's get into it. Mirror, mirror on the wall, what is it that I should share with the world?????

I am much more of a happy person now. I have, or so I thought, let it all go. But believe it or not, there will always be a time where those things you "let go" of, will creep right back up and present itself again. It may be a person, a phrase, a place, a song, a saying, a scent, a number, a date, anything!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I been sitting on this blog for almost a month now and in all honesty, I wanted to finish it last week, but I just been too lazy to do so! Every free time I had to myself, I wanted to sleep and that ain't right and yet, this blog will be so fitting.! I hear my Pastor say often, "Jesus is married to the backslider". At first, I really was struggling to understand that and didn't think it was like a big deal, but in all honesty, that is a HUGE deal!! In the dictionary, backslide is defined: to start doing bad again after you have stopped it, to lapse morally or in the practice of religion, and to revert to a worse condition. Basically backsliding is going back to wherever you came from. Its the being saved, but slipping back into the world, its the finally free from an abusive relationship, but going back months later because "they've changed", its repeating history all over again when you started writing a new book, or it can be as simple as slacking up in the things that you know you should be doing as a Christian (spending time with God, reading and studying His Word, attending church, praying, etc).

Funny thing is I haven't even begin to look for passages, but God makes His presence known. The other morning when I woke up, first thing I normally do is grab my phone. Now, in the beginning (of being saved), I would go to my Bible app and read some scriptures, but this particular morning, as I tapped on my Instagram app, I realized that I slid  aaaaalllll they way back! So, I closed it out, went to my Bible app and went to the daily readings for that day and lo and behold, it takes me to Jeremiah chapter 3. As I begin to read, I get to V6 and it says (KJV), "<em>The Lord said also unto me in the days of Josiah the king, Hast thou seen that which backsliding Israel hath done? she is gone up upon every high mountain and under every green tree, and there hath played the harlot.</em>" Funny right?? Then it goes on and say that God (V7) "<em>put her away and had given her a bill of divorce.</em>" See, He's married to the backslider.

When I think of marriage, I think of commitment, vows, oath, love, lifetime, happiness, trials, tribulations, test, and testimonies. I think of soul mate and that there is no one else. I think "this is it" and that's what it should be. Now, if Jesus is married to the backslider, with my thinking of what marriage is, I would say that He is one crazy man! Marrying, committing to , taking vows with, loving, having a lifetime of happiness with someone who falls off and/or goes back to where they came from. But really, He's not crazy because 9xs out of 10, MOST, no, Ima go out on a limb here and say ALL Christians backslide and if Jesus wasn't married to them, then how would they come or be welcomed back??? That's true, powerful, and agape love. This is why God IS love (1 John 4:8; 16). Only He can really possess this kind of love and it doesn't phase him. Before you are saved, you are a sinner. Psalms 51:5 (NET) says: "<em>Look, I was guilty of sin from birth, a sinner the moment my mother conceived me.</em>" So sin is in you and come on, its human nature to stick to things you know and what you're comfortable with. So as a sinner, you don't really think about "backsliding", you're already doing what it is you want to do, but as a Christian, you are made new, so what you used to do, you don't do anymore and that's where the backsliding comes into play.

But guess what!? As I continued to read Jeremiah chapter 3, the Lord calls for Israel and Judah (who backslid as well) to repent. V12 (KJV) says, "<em>Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return, thou backsliding Israel, saith the Lord; and I will not cause mine anger to fall upon you: for I am merciful. saith the Lord, and I will not keep anger for ever.</em>"...V14, "<em>Turn O backsliding children, saith the Lord; for I am married unto you: and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion.</em>"..V22, "<em>Return ye, backsliding children, and I will heal your backslidings.</em>" Isn't He an awesome husband!? He wants to keep us, to stay married to us. He is merciful. He says it Himself and God cannot tell a lie! I mean, come on, let's face it. You WILL backslid, some more than others, but nevertheless, your day and time will come. How wonderful is it knowing that even though you will let Him down, He's still there with open arms, telling you what to do. Return. Although you strayed away, all you have to do is turn around and come on back. The remedy my Pastor has for backsliding is to "slide back". It's just that simple. God doesn't want to stay angry at you forever. He just wants you to admit your wrong doings and do better next time. His mercies NEVER run out, but that doesn't mean they are there to take for granted.

So I leave you with this: Don't give up. If you backslid, don't stay there. Temporary feelings and happiness WILL wear off. Turn back and return to God. He wants you to do that and He will heal you of your backslidings. Repent to God and ask Him to show you how not to backslide again and allow Him to do so. You can and will outlive your last "mess up" and He's always looking to show you how He can turn your "mess" into your "best".

Blessings.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA["Jesus knows my heart". That saying makes me laugh now. Yes, it is a true statement, but what makes it funny to me now is because we don't know our own hearts. I remember always saying that when my grandfather used to ask why I didn't go to church, but in reality, it wasn't in my heart; I would have went if it was. So me saying that was basically saying, "Jesus knows that's not in my heart to go", but truthfully, I really meant "He knows I really want to go". "<em>Out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaketh</em>" Matthew 12:34 (KJV). Jesus was not in my heart and my actions and words proved so. I know church is at the same time every week and yet, I used to do and plan for everything BUT that! I would wake up early 5-6 days a week and sleep in late on Sundays, but "He knows my heart". If I just so happened woke up on time to go to church and felt a smidget of me not wanting to get out the bed, I would say, "Jesus knows my heart" or "that was no body by the devil keeping me in". But you know, at some point, YOU have to take responsibility for your own actions! That was all me. I was content with the life I was living and I didn't want to be convicted of it, but I still was being convicted. If God has His hands on you, you can't really escape from that no matter how hard you try. I mean, you can't hide from Him. Adam and Eve can testify to that! Yesterday, Pastor said, "Jesus always find you where you are. You just have to get there. You are never in a place where Jesus cannot find you". Well, where He found me was the LAST place I expected to hear from Him, but hey, Jesus knew my heart.

Flip side to that statement, I am happy that He knows my heart. Even though I was saying that but was showing different actions, I sincerely meant  the "right" thing to do. Then once I started to examine my own heart and get to know it, I realized I was just all wrong. I used to do and put everything before God and I wont lie, I still catch myself doing so even now, but its easier to see it and correct it now than it was back then. Being a Christian is a constant and daily progression. Just like with everything else, it takes work and it takes you doing a part. Actions, not just words. You cant just say, "yes, I'm a Christian" and still live worldly. Remember, Jesus knows your heart. So my question would be: Do you know your own heart and being as Jesus knows your heart, is it a product of Him and is He proud??

We must examine ourselves daily. 2 Corinthians 5:13 (KJV) tells us, "<em>Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates</em>." You must know yourself to examine yourself and then you have to prove yourself....seeeeeee.....WORK!!!! You do a part!! I wish it WAS easy to just say and not do and still get all the results, blessings, favors, and things I want. I want a flat tummy SO bad, and yet, not doing anything about it. **le sigh**  Must not want it that bad huh!? Smh...

But anywho! We will fail, but put it in your heart not to fail. Hide the Word in your heart, so that you may not sin against thee (Psalms 119:11, KJV). Get to know your heart like Jesus knows your heart. Prove yourself!

Philippians 4:8 (KJV): "<em>Finally brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things</em>".
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Father God, I come to you today, praying for each and everyone of us. Praying that we take the time out to examine ourselves and see ourselves as You see us. Dear Lord, I pray that we begin to use our actions more than our words and that not only we prove ourselves, but we prove You to be who You are. In Jesus name.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Amen.</em></p>

		<title>Just for once, outside of Thanksgiving, be thankful...</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So look, before I can get any work done, I just have to get this blog out! Alright, so this morning I'm driving to work finishing my convo with God and then all of a sudden this came to me. I forwarded a message with some friends and added a touch of myself and at the end of the message. I said, "Smile through the pain and dance in the rain". At the time I sent the message, I was just like, "oh that's cool, I like that", but a couple minutes later the Holy Spirit spoke and then that quote spoke volumes to me! Who in the heck wants to smile through the pain and dance in the rain?! Me personally, I want to sleep during both! But it spoke to me and got me to thinking. It so many demands we as believers place on God. So many things we, even non-believers, trust and believe God for. We are always praying and asking him for things, when in reality, its so much that we already have that we should be thanking Him for. All the small and simple things. I then thought of that song, "My Worship is For Real". The words say "You don't know my story. All the things that I've been through. You can't feel my pain, What I had to go through to get here. You'll never understand my praise. Don't try to figure it out, Because my worship, My worship, Is for real". Everyone's background is different. We all came through and from different things, some not as bad as others, and some that may even been the same, but nevertheless, we all came and overcame some things. Yesterday at church, we shared testimonies. Just hearing and seeing how God has been working and blessing people touched me so much! Now if you don't believe in Him or have faith, then you will never get this and I pray for you, because you are surely missing out. One lady shared her testimony on how she went from working 8hrs a day to 2 hours a day! What!? She stated that she stayed faithful to her job and worked those 2hrs like they were 8, praying, asking, trusting, and believing God for another job.......Well needless to say, she was blessed with another job! Another one I'll share that just brought tears to my eyes was this one from a guy. When he was about 16, he was suffering from migraines and had no clue where they were coming from, so he went to the doctor and they drew some blood and it turned out he had Spinal Meningitis. Now, from what he shared, he said they were 2 different kinds, one that would definitely kill him and another that wouldn't. He said he was praying to a God that he didn't believe in and the results came back as the less threatening one and because of Him he is still here. Ha! Talk about God works!!!

I guess the point of this blog is to finally, for once, not focus on the things God "need" to do for you, but to point out the things that He has already done. It's SO much we have to be grateful for and yeah, I know Thanksgiving is coming up, but I demand this challenge! Let's all take about 30 minutes out of our busy day from the things God has already blessed us with (school, kid(s), job, spouses) and just how as a child you wrote letters to a man that you've never seen and yet believed in, Santa Claus, write a letter to a Man that you are seeking to see and believe in, Jesus Christ, thanking Him for all of the things He's blessed you with. Get all to yourself and get real with yourself. Dig through all the old memories, whether good or bad, go back to those repressed memories and jot them all down. I bet you'll see more things that you have to be thankful for. Many situations you're going to think back on and realize it was nobody BUT God. If you want, you can comment and share here. Even though we didn't get a word from the Pastor, we got a word from others stories. Or at least I did! First lady said something yesterday that I liked to. I'm paraphrasing, but it was something along the lines of people not wanting to hear or believe that they received a word from God because it didn't come from the man of God, but God uses different vessels to deliver the same kind of water. I used to be like that, but now, I enjoy it from all kinds of ways. I love hearing personal testimonies. "<em>Rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep"</em> Romans 12:15 (KJV). I guarantee there is a blessing in store for you.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We, as humans, get so wrapped up in ourselves and what we think is right to where sometimes we blind ourselves from seeing what really is right! We justify things just to make ourselves feel better, when in reality, if we have to justify something, then it must not be right in the first place. 2 Timothy 4:3-4 (NET) "<em>For there will be a time when people will not tolerate sound teaching. Instead, following their own desires, they will accumulate teachers for themselves, because they have an insatiable curiosity to hear new things. And they will turn away form hearing the truth, but on the other hand they will turn aside to myths</em>". See, don't feel bad when this happen to you for it is written. V5 tells us what to do, "<em>You, however, be self-controlled in all things, endure hardship, do an evangelist's work, fulfill your ministry</em>". We are all here for a reason. God knew us before we were formed in our mother's womb (Jeremiah 1:5). Being as we know there is a season for everything, simply means we are going to go through everything. But you are to stand firm. Continue doing what you were called to do. Don't let other things alter or discourage you and get you off of your path. You decided to change for a reason, whatever that reason may be, in that moment you realized that doing things on your own led you nowhere and a change must take place. In the beginning, its awesome, you think you got it can't nothing stop you or steer you from venturing off and then the devil realize that you're doing TOO good for yourself. If you haven't been saved all your life, then you were once a follower of he, the devil. So guess what?! He knows you too! He knows what used to get you, what things you like, what things you yearned for, so he has means, sources, and things on you. He will dress whatever it is that you are praying and desiring for. If its love, he will dress it up and in chivalry, compassion, consistency, and all these other things that make you melt! But in reality, its not of God because although it makes you melt, it takes your mind elsewhere and the things we are told to think on (Philippians 4:8) goes out the window. It may not be love, it may be other things. You know what you're praying and believing God for. It could be a job, and one may come along that you believe is right for you, so you just jump on it only to realize that's not the one God have for you. You see, as much as we may think we do, we really don't know what we want or what's good for us and that's where the Holy Spirit comes in. He is in us for a reason. When you feel that "inkling" of something not working out, don't ignore it and try to fight it. Its there because He knows what's right for you and you fighting it is not doing anything but hindering your growth and stopping or prolonging what's to be right for you to come along. You have to keep reminding yourself daily that this is a FAITH walk. Hebrews 11:1 (KJV) says "<em>Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen</em>". You can't go off of what you see. You will never believe if you do that! True examples are those from the Old Testament, Hebrews 11 shares stories of some. They never seen Jesus, but believe God when He said that He will send a Messiah and they remained faithful to Him and had faith: Abraham, Moses, Sarah, Ruth, Daniel, Job, Isaiah, Samuel, David, just to name a few. We must follow in their footsteps. God fulfilled ALL of His promises to them, so what makes you different??? What makes you think He wont do the same for you.!? Rebuke that doubtful spirit, repent, and believe that what God says He will do, He will do! Reject self and accept help. Help from the right people though! Its a reason the Bible tells us not to be unequally yoked together with non believers (2 Corinthians 6:14). The two could never become one and fellowship. Philippians 2:2 (KJV) says: <em>"Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind</em>". If its two different worlds, two different feelings, how could something become one? One would have to change in order for that to happen. The "bad" would have to turn "good" or the "good" would have to turn "bad", but light and darkness cannot fellowship together.

I am convinced that it is us that get in our own way. The Bible tells us in Luke 9:23-24 (KJV) "...<em>If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me. For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it</em>". IT IS NOT ABOUT YOU! Here are clear, cut, and precise instructions! We are to deny self DAILY. Instead of letting God be Him and allow Him to do what He do, we try to take matters in our own hands and then conflict comes into play. You may think it'll be easy to just go back to the "old" you, but if God has His hand on you, it would most likely not be a smooth transition. You are His lost sheep, once you are found; yeah, you may wander of, but I can surely guarantee you that you will be back! There is not greater love, no better feeling, than being there in the presence of God.

Be Blessed

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today, I just want to talk about getting rid of self. It has been my daily prayer for the past couple of weeks to free myself from me. Since the beginning of time, the fall of man, we have been selfish people. The Bible speaks and teaches on selfishness and tells us how not to be selfish. 2 Timothy 3: 1-5 tells us (NET):: "But understand this, that in the last days difficult times will come. For people will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy, unloving, irreconcilable, slanderers, without self-control, savage, opposed to what is good, treacherous, reckless, conceited, loving pleasure rather than loving God. They will maintain the outward appearance of religion but will have repudiated its power. So avoid people like these." Although, for the most part, they are speaking about the church, which I'm sure we all can agree that this is true for most churches, but it also brings light to the people of "today's society" as well. The Bible tells us to love one another but ourselves tells us, "I don't like that person, (s)he didn't speak to me, so I'm not speaking to them". Man..let that evil spirit GO! It is not about you..! Jesus was a selfless man. He did nothing that He wanted to do, but everything that He was told to do by His Father. He is thee ultimate example of who we should be yearning to be like. Now, I'm not saying go out and be all fake about everything, trying to be all happy go luck when really you don't wanna be, God sees and reads your heart. Start off by praying about it. Ask God for discernment, ask Him to show you how to be happy when speaking to someone you know thinks ill about you. Ask Him to show you how to put someone else before you (not before Him tho) without losing yourself in the process. Ask Him to show you how to rejoice with others in their joyous times when yours is dark. Ask Him to show you how not to be selfish. Pastor just spoke last Sunday on surrendering it all and how it's a process. I haven't even been saved for a full year yet and I am learning that just about everything is a process! Some things will come quickly and some things will not. But just how it took a process for you to get to where you are now..it's gonna take a process to get you to where you're going to be! Each day I feel myself being freed from myself and it's a wonderful feeling. My prayers I feel are getting better, my faith is getting stronger, and my relationship with myself and other people seems to be blossoming more. I think a lot of fear comes from the "what if" mindset and that's just another mechanism of our own selves getting in the way of potential destiny. Sometimes you have to take that risk regardless of what that "what if" is. And guess what!? It just so happens that "what if" was true, you canNOT let that linger on with you because it will hinder you! Appreciate it for what it was, take from it what you need to take from it, learn from it, and continue to seek and continue to grow and go forward. Some things are either a lesson or a blessing..and sometimes it may be both! And yes, I know that things are "easier said than done", but as stated before, it is a process. The more you do something the easier it will be. Praying for other people used to be hard for me. I was all about self and family. But just how you going through things and want your families to be safe, protected, healed, or whatever the case may be, so is someone else down the road praying, hoping, needing, and wishing the same thing. Now, I've been throwing other people in the mix and I have been seeing change and growth all around me. People don't even be realizing it, but I be knowing. Baby, prayer works! And when you bless others, God will surely bless you. Remember, not to do it for the glory of man, but for the glory of God. Matthew 6:1 (NET):: "Be careful not to display your righteousness merely to be seen by people. Otherwise you have no reward with your Father in heaven."

Be blessed.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So yesterday, I had a moment. Started thinking about my grandfather and just couldn't take it anymore. Left Bible Study, rode around crying because I didn't want my grandmother to see me that way and have to deal with me. It's so much she do already and deal with, I didn't want to burden her. As I'm driving, I just couldn't help but to think of the "devil" himself. Ugh! Like he always been there, especially around my grandfather's passing. That's why I really hate to think about it or get sad about it because he was the one to comfort me and I know that's not a road that I need to be travelling on anymore. And even though I have somebody in my life that I believe I can go to in times like this, I just find it hard to do it. I guess because I don't really know like "where we stand", but then again, I guess I do...I don't know. I just much rather not think about it, but then, that's where my problem comes in. Blah! 
You know, I always thought that this whole "mate" thing would be easy once you start "living right", but I'm seeing its really not. Kinda a little bit more complicated/confusing sometimes.. From reading some people stories (females), it was always, "and I knew he was the one"...I'm beginning to question that though. Pretty much everywhere I read in the Bible so far, the man always knew the woman, since Adam, because woman came from man. "Bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh" Genesis 2:23 (KJV). So what I'm getting is that we are not supposed to know. But then I'm like, "that's crazy!" Woman should know to so it can save her time, energy, and all that jazz. And I'm guessing that's where the Holy Spirit and discernment comes in at. Women should not be searching or looking for a mate, he should be the one searching and looking for you (I get that). Women are to be so focused on God to where your spirit will draw his spirit to you, the one that God has specifically for you!
So now, I'm back to questioning myself. Like I give my all when dealing with a person and then I fight myself like, "no Danika, don't be doing all that", but that's just me, that's in my nature. I believe you get what you give. Then I remember all the times I've been told "I'm too good" or "intimidating" or "worth more" and all that jazz and I'm just baffled! But in reality, I should be happy about that, because WHOEVER he is, must be some GREAT and GRAND individual for these people to see and recognize all of "this" in me and let it go. I don't know. I just try not to think about it...again! You know what else gets me tho!? Like when dudes be like, "you're single...do as you please". That slick side ticks me off! I don't really get that. I mean, obviously the person is single if they're asking you a question as to dating other people, so why even point that out AND if everything is all so fine and dandy, why would you basically give others permission to see the "greatness" this one person possess?? I guess that can be like a defense mechanism or like a ego thing from dudes, idk, but in my experience, I see it as dude just saying, "girl look, I don't care what you do because I don't care about you" and then when you go and "do as you please" it's a problem. **rolls eyes** This must be why I never was good at dating and just much rather dive in there head first.. The games...just stupid. **shrugs** But now I have to ask.......since being told that and feeling that's what it means....why don't you "do as you please"???? Hmmmm....maybe because the "please" is to continue doing what you're doing oooooooor is it because you don't want to lose or mess up what you already have going for you??? Whatever that may be!? **Sigh** 
Then, I see all these people in relationships "happy" (Quotes for a reason...never know the truth behind the smile), getting engaged, married, and having babies and I'm genuinely happy for them, but I'll be lying if I said I don't be feeling some type of way within myself. I don't be so much envious, but I always get down in the dumps. Like every time I see my nephew with his mom, I always want to cry. Like I want that....sooooooooo bad!! But I refuse to force it or settle for it. I just keep reminding myself that my time is coming and that there's a season for everything, and this is the time I need to be getting myself together. 
I remember my people always telling me that I'm always looking for the perfect relationship, which is not true! I'm so far from perfect that it would be extremely dumb of me to want that! Why would I want something I can't offer?! You'll probably never get perfection from me....but you'll get my very best! I remember Pastor saying one time, "The relationship becomes imperfect the minute YOU become a part of it." Now, how true is that!? I'm very closed when it comes to my feelings and stuff because when I was extremely opened with them.........ima just leave that alone, BUT I can say that I'm genuine and when I do open up, its very rare, sincere, and real. "Kindness for weakness" right!? Idk man....I always say me being me and me being single is bittersweet, but I can't help but to continue on being me and doing me until he comes and find his "helpmeet". 
If this was all over the place and/or confusing.....the only thing I can say is Welcome!! Now just imagine how I be feeling! **insert my favorite emoji here** &lt;--some people would know what that is! haha

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Flipping through the pages in my text book, I stopped on a page talking about suicide. It published some suicide notes people left behind and I read them and couldn't help but to feel like a drop in my heart. At first, I was like, "dang, these people was really like, 'bump this, I'm killing myself'" and then I got shook. I was one of them people. I contemplated suicide on numerous of occasions and attempted twice. Not something I go around broadcasting, but its the truth. Suicide does not have a face, a race, a class, an age; suicide comes in all different shapes, colors, sizes, and forms. I mean, don't get me wrong, I am UBERLY excited to not have successfully killed myself because I can live to say that that "low" at that time is not the worst, life has a strange way of unfolding things.

For as far back as I can remember, I always felt unwanted. Hearing that you were a "trick" to get here, being rushed into school, witnessing domestic violence, being "touched" (and not by the Holy Spirit), called "ugly", "fat", being told "you'll never amount to anything", being called an "hoe" by your own family, only praised for doing good in school to rub it in the face of others and pretty much place your peeps on a pedestal, feeling unloved, unwanted, and like you didn't belong, losing yourself for the sake of "having a man (or woman)"; its pretty easy to want to escape that FOREVER! I remember always feeling like I didn't have any one to talk to because no one would understand. I was always just told, "oh girl, you're over reacting, get over it" or called a "drama queen", then as I got older, it just became much easier to hold things in (working on it!). I used to talk to myself and cry myself to sleep plenty of nights, losing myself in songs, asking God, "why me, what have I done to deserve this!?"

I've never been good at expressing myself verbally, but always been writing since a child. I remember cleaning out my room one day and finding things I've written but never gave to anyone and chuckled a little bit. I always thought I started writing back in the 10th grade after my first heartbreak, but I've been writing! How ironic is that!? In Jeremiah 1:5 (NET), God says, "<em>Before I formed you in your mother's womb I chose you. Before you were born I set you apart.</em>" So now I'm seeing that while I was swarming around with my brothers and sisters that didn't make it, I was already DESTINED to be CHOSEN and SET APART. How cool is that!? Now if I would have succeeded in killing myself, I would have never read that verse a day in my life and realized this, because baby, let's be honest, before I rededicated my life to Christ, the only time my Bible got action was when I felt like I needed to go to church and that was only to read the verses talked about that morning. Nothing more, nothing less. The Bible is so interesting, I wish I would have been gotten into it, but it wasn't my time yet. I was still being worked on and still being worked on.

But anywho, this blog is about suicide and the feeling of "unwantedness". Just listened to Sarah Jakes talk about being and feeling like an outcast. I'm sure quite of few of us feel this way, and I know I'm not alone in this. For that simple fact alone should give hope. There is life after hurt, that is joy after pain, that is smiling after the tears. I've been through so many lows in my life to where I figured I couldn't go back there anymore, but guess what?! I did!!! And I placed myself there from going against Him and what I knew. But now, even on my lowest days, I still smile and say, "God, I know there is much better than this and I am looking forward to it" and there is NO way I am saying that its all glitz and glam living a "saved" life, because it's not, you will still experience some things that life throws at you, but the difference now, for me at least, is that I have someone to go to and talk to when once upon a time, I wanted to die, or drink till I couldn't remember what caused me to drink in the first place, or get me some to "relieve some stress" and have temporary pleasure. Being as I see now what its like to not do those things and cast my burdens to Him, I would highly recommend it to all people. He don't want you to take your life or waste your life away, He wants to give you life so that you may live it to capacity and more abundantly! (John 10:10)

In the words of Sarah Jakes, "God will not break you without purpose". Don't give up. Pastor once said, "Don't conclude life is over just because you are in a season. Just live another day. If it's bad and can't get any worse, why not live another day!?" Suicide is very cowardly, didn't know it at the time, but I know it now. Don't allow yourself to become such person, you are stronger than you think. Just look at the fact of how I just put myself on blast! And don't let NO body tell you who you are, what you will amount to, or talk down to and/or belittle you, because man has no say so, man has no control, BUT GOD! You tell them, and you stand on that, and you become that!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[You ever look back on something and say to yourself, "What was I thinking?!" Sometimes I wonder if God says that to Himself with us. Like after He free us or deliver us from something and we go right back to it or after we ask Him for forgiveness and we go right back into the same sin. I wonder if He ever regret the things He's done for us. Like not killing us all or even giving His only Begotten Son for that matter!? But nah, cuz in John 3:17 it says that He sent Him not to condemn us, but that through Him we might be saved. So He knew what He was doing. God is so good with wordplay. Have you ever peeped that out?! Like every "all, some, might, will, shall, few, many", etc. are so strategically placed in its proper verse to where you can't do nothing but take it for what it is. "For MANY are called, but FEW are chosen." Matt 22:14 (KJV)  "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter into the kingdom of heaven-only the one who does the will of my Father in heaven." Matt 7:21 (NET)

"When I think about Jesus and all He's done for me, when I think about Jesus and how He set me free, I can dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance all night!!" No, really I can! Y'all, I really can't put in words all the things God has done for me and how I feel. I was scrolling down my Facebook of all my past posts, pics, and comments, and baby, let me tell you! I was one schizo/bipolar/lost little child. One minute I was in love, the next, cursing somebody out, then saying "Thank you Lord", and lastly in love with somebody else. Seemed like all in the same day or week! Crazy thing is I can recall who/what took place for me to post for the most part and let's just say I am happy those days are gone!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Sometimes forgiveness is just as simple as saying, "I forgive you." I think that people tend, well I know that I tend, to "run" away from issues because I don't want to deal with them or face them, but let me tell you, they will NEVER go away unless you deal with them.

I just had a recent, short, conversation with someone that I have been avoiding because I didn't want to deal with that particular situation and it was something that I was holding on to for YEARS....but you see, I was running from it and it kept coming back, catching up with me. You see, no matter how far ahead in the race you think you've gotten, it will always catch up with you, and if you don't deal with it, it will eventually win! You know the story about the tortoise and the hare. Well, the tortoise is your problem, and the hare is you. The hare thought he had it, but in the end, the tortoise won. Don't let tortoise beat you.

Forgiveness is really, really, really a hard thing to do! And even after you forgive, its still work to do. What's that work?? Letting it go! Oh my gosh!!! We, as people, hold on to things for a looooooooong, long time! So, does that mean we truly  forgave?? We are taught to forgive and forget right? Isaiah 43:25 tells us that God "<em>will not remember thy sins"</em>, so why should we remember those of others? Or even ours for that matter?

Confession:: I have a not so clean background...but guess what!? I'm not the only one! Only person with a clean background WAS Jesus...none before and none after. So now, sitting here, typing this, in my head I'm like, "Man! I'm tripping"... What kind of jackoff am I being beating myself up off of things that happened in the past, holding on to hurt, anger, bitterness, and all those things that are NOT like Jesus and yet I want to be more like Him.!? Crazy right?? It is. As I was doing my research on the topic of forgiveness and forgetting I ran across a certain passage that opened my eyes. Now, I've read this book before, but I remember a Brother in the church saying how you can go back and read a passage again and notice a different scripture or read it in a different way, and I must say, this is one of those instances. Philippians 3:12-14 (NET) "<em>Not that I have already attained this-that is, I have not already been perfected-but I strive to lay hold of that for which Christ Jesus also laid hold of me. Brothers and sisters, I do not consider myself to have attained this. Instead I am single-minded. Forgetting the things that are behind and reaching out for the things that are ahead, with this goal in mind, I strive toward the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus." </em>I read this and was like, "Pow! He told you!" This passage tells us that you never was perfect, but now, if you're saved, you're striving for better, so make up your mind and forget the things that are behind and go ahead and reach for that which is ahead. The prize is so much if only you would let go of what's holding back and move onward.

So how about it?? Are you gonna make that phone call, send that text, write that letter, make it up in your mind, and/or look in the mirror and forgive whomever or whatever it is you need to forgive? Like Jesus asked the man at the pool, "<em>Wilt thou be made whole?</em>" God forgave, forgot, forgives you, and forgets your sins and as Christians, we are to be "Christlike"...so howsabout we be like our Father and take a page out of His book and follow His lead!?

PS... 'Tis is easier said than done, so as I pray for myself in this area, I shall pray for you all who struggle here as well.

Be blessed

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Mannnnn, this definitely wasn't my plan to blog tonight. I thought I was just gonna stop writing some poetry, take a shower, say my prayers and go to sleep; but apparently HE had other plans for me, and I must be obedient. So yeah...

Now, you can't judge me, but apparently me and God be having the most best, intimate, and revealing conversations EVER when I am in the shower. Part of me relate it to be in the Garden before sin came along, you know, all naked and free, and another part of me look at it like while I'm washing the dirt off from my today, He's also cleansing me of my sins of the day, but whichever way, the conversation is there.

So tonight, I'm taking my shower and He asks me, "So Danika, who or what am I to you?" I'm like **scoffs** "Seriously dude, You're like everything to me!" And He's like, "Nah my child, that's not what I'm asking you, I need you to dig deep." I ain't like that, but I did it. Flashbacks started coming to me.. I recalled quite a few times driving home drunk from a night out of partying or just drinking, but then again, it was always a party where there were drinks for me, anywho..off topic, and there were quite a few times I don't remember driving or knowing how I made it home, so I was like, "Ok Lord, you were my protector." He was like, "Good, that's a start." Then I remember this one time I snuck out the house, and before doing so I prayed and promised Him that if He would keep me from getting caught, that I would never do it again. I didn't get caught (and never did it again), and even though I was doing wrong, He was my watchman. I used be a liar, like for no reason, eventually it caught up with me and I lost my mom's trust (worst thing EVER by the way), but He got me out some stuff and pleaded my case, so He was my Lawyer. He's been my doctor, my healer, my comforter, my friend. So as I'm reflecting, saying, and realizing all this, I'm like, "Well, God, why are you asking me this?" **Mental note, don't ask Him questions and not be prepared for the answers** This guy slapped me ALL the way in the face, He said, "So since you know that I am and have been these things to you once before, why do you not trust me to be it all to and for you now?" Woooooow!!! Talk about a Spirit Check! You know, it's like a bittersweet thing to me when He's the one, personally checking you, and He's not using another entity to do so. It gives me that sense of a Father/Daughter relationship and comfort cuz it's like, "man, He's really taking time out to chat it up with me, I MUST be special to Him" and that makes the conviction and discipline easier to take. "<em>My son [daughter], despise not the chastening of the Lord; Neither be weary of His correction: For whom the Lord loveth, He correcteth; Even as a father the son in whom he delighteth."</em> Proverbs 3:11-12 (KJV). If He didn't care, He wouldn't chastise or correct, He would just let you continue on as you were without Him. But I thank God for His discipline. He's always right, whether you want to admit it or not.

Funny as I'm typing this because just today in church we were talking bout being predestined and how He foreknew us before we were saved (Romans 8:29-30) and Pastor said something along the lines of always having a "Godly conscious" even when you were doing wrong and that is sooooo true! Clearly you can see that He's been with me even before I fully accepted Him as my Lord and Savior, making vows to Him knowing that I was outside of His will and yet, He STILL came through for me. Why!? Because He FOREKNEW that I would be sitting here tonight writing this blog. You can't tell me God is NOT good! He glorified, justified, called, predestined, and foreknew me to be available and acceptable for those situations to occur in my life, so He could come through for me and for me to reflect and realize the reality of it all and share it. God was right, before I knew Him, I trusted Him, and now that I know Him, I'm doubting Him. How backwards is that?!

My whole purpose of writing this blog tonight is just to truly reflect on who He is and what He is to you and to say that He always is...and that's just it!. He is... "<em>I AM THAT I AM" </em>(Exodus 3:14) is He. What He was back then; He can and will be today, tomorrow, and forever. "<em>Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, and today, and forever" </em>Hebrews 13:8 (KJV). There is no changing for Jesus. He healed you before, He can do it again, He delivered you before, He can do it again, He comforted you before, He can do it again. Whatever you need, He can and shall provide (Philippians 4:19). Just trust Him. Truly let God be your everything and watch how your everything unfolds.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA["No matter what you do or where you go, you can't escape yourself." --line from "Awkward." Man...How deep is that!? I had to rewind and replay that line over and over again.. It was just what I was feeling...even now. I just had the "luxury" of going on a cruise. Escaped from everything: life, family, friends, social media, work; it all and it was GREAT! It was great because I didn't have to deal with reality. Not having to deal with it was the best feeling in the world. Being trapped inside of this big boat that had everything, but a movie theater, in the middle of NO where was just what I needed dealing with everything that I'm dealing with. It could have been longer, but the truth is exactly what Mr. Hart said in that quote. All the ills of my life, no matter what I do or where I go, I can't escape it, it will always be there for as long as I don't deal with it. Could have been on the boat for months, wouldn't have changed a thing.

I love a great escape, why?! Because when I started to look back, that's all I knew, all I see. I'm surrounded by people who cover stuff up. Sweep it under the rug type thing. Crazy thing is that blowed me about them, like I never felt right about that, but the truth of the matter is, I am the same doggone way! I would blow stuff off, put it under the repressed barrier and go on bout my what I think is "merry" way. Is it healthy!? Heck nah!!! Why?! Cuz it creeps back up. So now what?? You have to live life, what do you do??? You deal with it!!

I had the honor of having my "rights" read to me one night. I didn't want it, nor did I ask for it, but God knew I needed it. I know what my problem is and I would acknowledge it, but I wouldn't do anything about it and that's where the problem comes in. I remember my Pastor saying something about being the best "you" you could be. I believe we were talking about being used and maximizing that. And that's been playing in my head because I sometimes find myself questioning who I am. I'm sure that's another blog for another day though.

So! Truth of the matter is... Reality is real. Whatever is going on in your life is really happening. It is your choice to see, acknowledge, accept, deal with it, and live through it. "Through" because eventually it will end. It makes absooooooolutely NO sense in letting your "situation" kill you right then and there. Yes, things are hard...this is true, but you are not alone. I don't know what you go through, you don't know what I go through, but the thing in common is that we all go through! There is no getting around it. What I try to do now is look for God in every situation. Try to figure out what it is that He is saying to me or wanting me to see. Realize that seasons MUST change. Remembering the goods outweigh the bads. God is with me always (Matthews 28:20), and again, I am not alone. It all starts with you. God has plans for us all, but He can't do anything with it without participation from us. We have to "man up" and face our problems, our situations; instead of running away, escaping, sweeping it under the rug, or pretending like it doesn't matter or bothering us. Its time to suit up. You're not happy with a situation, call it out...do something about it, and make a change!!

Be blessed, you got this!

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I find it interesting how we find "joy" or maybe even a sense of freedom in isolation from our reality.. yet deep down inside we really don't want to "have to be" isolated..we don't want that "need" to be unreachable from those we normally interact with on a daily basis---be it loved ones of not---if that makes any sense.  The quote from "Awkward" only placed a bigger weight on my shoulders--not only for its obvious truth...but also because I, too, am guilty of loving the getaways, the missings-in-action, the outta-sight/outta-mind mentality or simply being the....runaway. It's SO easy to "sweep it under the rug" as you say or respond to our situations with a *shrug*... *flips hair* ....or the infamous "I'm over it" declaration... but He STILL waits on us; He STILL reaches down to help us out when we begin to sink a little too deep into ourselves!! After reading this post and fighting whatever it is going on inside of me...all I can think about is God's faithfulness to our struggles--even when we look for the first "elation" to abandon them.... "In my distress I called upon the LORD, And cried to my God for help; He heard my voice out of His temple, And my cry for help before Him came into His ears." (Psalms 18:6 NASB)

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So we all know with the new year approaching, there's a bunch of "new" mindsets running around here. Now I'm all for revamping yourself and things, but that don't just happen with the change of the date. I mean, it can, but you have to take necessary steps. I will admit, I have separation anxiety, but I started taking steps for a change.

I used to always wonder why people always said to move on from someone to "unfollow, block, delete, change your number", or whatever else to get rid of them and now I see! I've been talking changing my phone number for quite some time and I was like, "you know what, new year, new number, new me," and then it dawned on me, like, "nah...if you gon do it Danika, just do it, what's stopping you?!" So, I started taking steps and got it changed and when I tell you, I finally got what they were talking about!! Tis amazing!! It's like a whole new chapter. You now controls who can contact you, you determine who needs to know of this "change" and who doesn't and the best part of it all is that you don't owe any explanations! I mean, yeah, I probably could have kept my same number and still controlled that, but truth be told, it takes a LOT of energy to actively ignore people. Plus, I needed to be free from ALL ties whatsoever with certain people and this was the way. You can "block" them, but I tried that before and still was receiving messages. But anywho!!! With this fresh start, it helped me take even MORE steps. I started deleting next. Cleaning out the phone book. What's the point of me having your number and you don't have mine? That's not going to do anything but later serve as a temptation, and why put myself in that situation?! I met a lot of great and new people in 2013, but that does not mean they should roll over to 14 with me. They served their time, played their parts, I got whatever it was that I was to take from it and now its time to be done with it. I think a lot of us hold on to things because deep down we "hope" that it would resurface for the better, but let's be real; most likely it wont! Dude (or whoever) can hit you up months, even a year from now, and still be the same. So why get your hopes up for that!? And in reality, you still holding on to that is only hindering you from moving on. I remember last time I changed my number couple years back was to get rid of some dude, but ol silly me gave dude my new number anyways!! Don't do that! If you're changing it to be free from a particular person, be free, don't go back. Luckily, this go round I changed it for me. As much as I say that I'm over a particular person or situation, the fact that they could just "hit me up" whenever they pleased kinda excited me. Why!? Because they were good people and we had great times together, and maybe, just maybe the next time they "hit me up" they had this great epiphany and became the person I wanted them to be! HA!!!! Lies!!! That's the things that has to go. The mentality that you need to be freed from . Its a bondage, hindrance, mind control. Justifying is not the way. (Man, how many times I need to repeat that!)

Now, I'm not saying that every time something don't go right to change your number, no! What I'm saying is that change is necessary and required and it sometimes cost for things like a new number, location, job, whatever to happen. It's not just something that happens automatically with the change of a year. You should be constantly changing throughout the year. Why!? Because your seasons changes. From January 1st to December 31st, you should not be the same person. You declared a "new you" with the coming of a new year, so why would you be okay with still being the same.?! This year, I want a new me, not like I'm a totally new person who forgot where she came from, but a more improved me. I want to enjoy my freedom in Christ and no longer be a slave in bondage to the world. To "control" (with God) who/what I welcome in my life, "alt" what needs to be altered, and "delete" who/what needs to be deleted and not think twice about it. Live for the day, forgive so that I can be forgiven, and not be led into temptation. You know, make better Spirit led decisions and not "Danika/emotions" led decisions.

I don't know what 2014 has in store, but I'm getting suited up and ready for what He has in store!!!!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center">"<em>Love is patient, love is kind, it is not envious. Love does not brag, it is not puffed up. It is not rude, it is not self-serving, it is not easily angered or resentful. It is not glad about injustice, but rejoices in truth. It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never ends." </em>1 Corinthians 13:4-8 (NET)</p>
Love. Never. Ends.

This morning, I woke up with this verse playing over and over in my head. I know every time I tell the same story about being in love with this one guy and now that I dig deep into this Word, I realize that it wasn't love. Some serious like, but definitely not love. I believe it's been playing over and over for me because I've been holding on to the fact that "I loved him and it ended, so its gonna be hard for me to love again." LIES!!! I believe this was an eye opener for me to say, "you think you've experienced love, but you haven't. Love never ends." I just so happened was laying on the couch playing with my phone and something told me to go catch up on some blogs. I did so and came across one of Sarah Jakes' blogs called, "Survive Again". Yet, again, I thought about my "love". She said: "I took you with me everywhere I went. I needed the memory of you with me so that I wouldn’t forget what to avoid the next time. I wasn’t hanging on to you because it felt good I needed to be cautious. I couldn’t be burned. I wanted to avoid meeting anyone like you ever again. If I carried you in my heart I would never forget how I ended up here. I hated who you made me become. Weaker than I could ever imagine, more wounded than I knew possible." That's exactly what I've been feeling. I never wanted to feel how I felt with him with another person, so I kept him with me as a reminder and anytime I felt "him" in another dude, it was time to cut the cord. But I wasn't doing me any justice, I was only doing me harm. "Taking you with me" entails that I'm not letting go. You can't move on if you haven't moved past.

Broken? Bitter?? Battered??? Yes, I was all of that! As much as I put a smile on my face, say I'm not, believed I moved on, and was ready for the next one; was merely just a mask that is now being revealed to me. I am learning to love me. To be patient and kind, not envious, not bragging, puffed up, rude, self-serving, easily angered or resentful to and with myself. Realizing the injustice I have been causing myself over the past years, I'm not happy about, but the truth that I am now seeing, I am rejoicing! Me loving me is the start of me loving someone else. Me understanding the truth about this emotion and feeling that so many others take for granted is molding me and shaping me into the "helper" I was created to be. The deeper I press into God, the more my self-worth is revealed to me. People may say, "your standards are too high", "you're never going to find a guy like that", "you got to settle for something", "you're looking for perfect and ain't nobody perfect", "you're gonna be single forever"; don't let those things linger into your head and fill it with doubt! In a matter of SECONDS, Jesus turned water into wine, with a simple question, a paralyzed man was able to walk again, with a slight touch of His hem, a woman was instantly healed. This verse doesn't say that love is perfect, so perfection is not the goal. Love is the goal. If Jesus have standards, so should you. He doesn't say, "you can follow me and still do as you please", no! If that was the case, the road would not be narrow, but wide as all outdoors! You owe it to yourself to believe He who has it all, who knows it all, who sees it all, and who is writing it all. "Why pray and worry?" Why pray about a mate and then worry if He's gonna send you one or not.?! Redirect your focus. Pastor said Sunday, "In order to press forward, you have to 're' something: RE-new, RE-dedicate, RE-commit, RE-evaluate". Let us all RE-act to the press and go where it is we need to go.

Don't carry anyone with you that should not be with you. You have to take up YOUR cross and follow. RE-lease people from your heart so that you may have room for Him to RE-veal and RE-lease the desires of your hearts to you. I would hate to see you stay at the same place while others are moving from your own doing. (and this is for me too!) Jesus is asking, "Will thou be made whole???" And it is a simple, "yes", don't even say "no". You owe it to yourself to love because God loves you and if HE can love you despite ALL your wrong doings, who are you to not love yourself!? Have glory in that, make peace with that, and believe in that. My brother, my sister, you are worth SO MUCH and you have so much to offer and to give. Don't let NO body take that away from you. He is a RE-storer, He can RE-establish you. Your heart has been broken into a million pieces??? Gather all of the pieces you can, even if some are missing, bring it to Him, lay it at His feet and say, "God, this is all of me, I give this to you and I want to be made whole, what will you do with this?" And watch how He turns your mess into a masterpiece!!

Be whole.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[First and foremost, Happy New Years all!!!!

The past few days in the new year, I've been feeling some discomfort from myself and folks around me, so I just started praying. The other night, I just wasn't feeling it; so I kinda just pushed God to the side and went to sleep. Granted, the next day I did repent. Well, this morning I was given a revelation that I shared with some friends: "If things aren't going your way, you're feeling down in the dumps, or that you should be doing or receiving better, just remember: after emotional roller coasters, discomforts, stress, bed rest, and labor pains, something beautiful is birthed." Now, I've never had any kids, but I guess with the two births that just happened recently, labor and giving birth was fresh on my mind. It's very easy to get distracted by things of other people when its not happening to you. Let me piggy back for a second, before I got that revelation I told God that I wanted a microwave miracle and that's wrong. The microwave is used to make cold things warm. Sometimes its still cold and you have to reheat it more than once, you may lose flavor in whatever it is you're microwaving, and if you don't eat it fast enough, it may get right back cold. In other words, the microwave is a quick fix. Food taste much better when it's cooked and prepared timely and properly. With the right seasoning, heat, and time, you will have a great meal and enjoy it a little bit more because you've put EFFORT into it. It wasn't no one else's work, but yours and you take pride in that meal. So bam! Just like with giving birth; it takes time, patience, effort. Guy and girl meet, guy and girl hits it off, guy and girl fall in love, guy and girl gets married, husband knows wife, wife is pregnant, wife goes into labor, husband and wife now have a baby. Of course it doesn't happen this way majority of the time nowadays, but you get my drift. All of that is a process. Some people have microwave babies and "skip the fall in love/married part", and jump from "guy and girl meet" straight to "guy knowing girl, pregnant, labor, baby". Regardless, microwave or cooking; after man knows woman (sperm fertilizes egg), before the baby gets here, momma has to go through some labor pains and that's what I want to talk about today.

Life can be just like a pregnancy, just like labor pains. You can receive an epidural (a break from it), but even those wear off sometimes and you continue to feel everything. In the midst of all of that, something amazing happens. Birth! New life. I hear that once you see your child for the first time, all of that pain, stress, and everything you've endured was all worth it.  I want us to try and look at life like that. We all may not go through actual labor, but long as you have lived and continue living, all of us have gone through, is going through, or will go through different trials and tribulations where while we are in it, we are uncomfortable, screaming, crying, asking for the pain to go away, yelling, "give me that epidural NOW", and when we are out of it, we will see that we've overcame and what/who we became in the end was all worth it. As soon as we see ourselves for the first time after all of that, we will smile and say, "it was all worth it. Look how precious, look how beautiful you are."

I know I am not the first to say that its easy to keep your head up when everything around you is tugging at your hair, but each day is a new chance to say, "you know what!? It may hurt now, but in the end, something beautiful will become of this". Or, its a new day to cut your hair off! Just kidding. But really, hang in there. God is still growing and developing you. Eventually you will be born and see that the process you just went through was all worth it. Stay encouraged. Some people be in labor for a few hours, some almost over a day! Each person and each process is different, but they all can possess the same results.

Pray for me as I pray for all others who may be having labor pains right now. Pray for strength to endure even when the epidural has worn off. Pray to see and focus on the outcome rather than the what's happening now. "'<em>For I know the plans I have for you' declares the Lord, 'plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future'.</em>"  Jeremiah 29:11 (NIV) Pray with me to trust Him and believe He will deliver because He is not a man who can tell a lie; He is God.

Seleh.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA["Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubies." (Proverbs 31:10 KJV)

It has been said that rubies are the most valuable gems in the world and that they are rare.

Valuable:: worth a lot of money, very useful or helpful, important and limited in amount, having desirable or esteemed characteristics or qualities, of great use or service.

Rare:: marked by wide separation of component particles, marked by unusual quality, merit, or appeal, distinctive, superlative or extreme of its kind, seldom occurring or found, uncommon.

Are you selling yourself short or are you maximizing what you are?! Are you blending in with the crowd or are you standing tall, virtuous, and proud.? The Bible asks us, "Who can find a virtuous woman?" Are you interested in being found or are you just hoping that someone comes along and notice you blending with the speckles in the ground?? Rubies are rare, expensive, useful, important, unusual, distinctive, uncommon. Are you lacking these qualities?? People take pride in their possessions, they lock up all of their treasures. They are aware of the value and in the hands of the wrong person, jewels are taken for granted. A ruby doesn't fret when a diamond is purchased. A ruby understands that it's created only for the one who's worthy. The one who will cherish and admire it for how beautiful it is. Who will honor it, respect it, and protect it from harsh environments. Do you see yourself virtuous??!? Do you know how much you're worth!!?! God says, "her price is FAR above rubies". He says you are FAR above the most rarest and valuable gem in the world. He is searching for you. Man is on a hunt to answer God and say, "yes, I've found one. Here is she. This is my virtuous woman whom I will love, honor, cherish, and respect. Never to give her second best. The search has ended and she is so valuable to me." A woman who recognizes, knows, and illustrates her worth is a woman that God is asking for.

There are so many common gems in the world that when one stumble upon a ruby they can't help but to pause. God has man on a hunt. You, woman, is what man is searching for. Virtuous. Having or showing high moral standards. Yes baby! You with the war wounds and scars are worthy. You've been sold to different pawn shops way under your value and I am here to tell you that the pawn shops are now closed. Sell yourself short no more. Have pride in yourself. Know that your price is far above! God calls you virtuous. So now tell me....... What. Is. Your. Worth???

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[To the one who's reading this. I miss you. I love you and I desire to have a relationship with you. It sucks that we are one of the same flesh and blood and yet, I just feel so alone. We are distant, when I want to be close. I don't know what to do or how to get through and/or close to you, so I pray. I pray, I pray, and I pray. Praying that the Lord speaks to you and calls you so that we may have one thing in common outside of the blood that we share, which should be enough, but its not. If there's anything I've done to steer you away, I am sorry and I forgive you for the tears I've shared, the pain you've caused, and the bitterness I've held in my heart towards you even if you're sorry or not. I want you to be free and have a prosperous and happy life. I want you to be and have all of the desires of your heart. I want you to have the family that you desire to have. A better one that was an example to you. You are better than your past, you are better than your father, and you can start a new trend and dream for your seeds. I know you didn't have the motivation that you may have hoped for, but just know you are worth it all. You are worth the compliments, the "I'm proud of you for what you have done and accomplished", you are worth that! Know that!! You can be and have all that you want if you would just get out of your own way. Change your thoughts, change you mind. Begin to see life for all that it is. Embrace your days with a positive attitude and make the best out of each of them. Love the ones that are around you because you never know when you will see the last of them. Don't give up. Keep fighting not for you but for the lil ones. You have a legacy to leave, a life to impact. Be a great example. Be the person you wish you had to look up to. I know its hard, things are not looking like its going your way, but I know God has big things in store. I believe He will bless those I love through me. My desire is for you to get to know Him for yourself. To have the blessings over you and your house. He can heal if you just trust Him. He can prosper you, if you would bless Him. He desires to have a relationship with you and WE are not giving up. The questions will still come, the invite will always be there, and the prayers wont stop. I know you're hurting inside just as I was and I want to be by your side even though you wasn't at mine. I pray that something shakes so mightily that you know it was nobody BUT God and that a miracle happens for you. If ever you feel that no one is there for you, be sure in knowing that I will always be. Right here along with God. I love you and I need you. There are some people who's depending on you. Its time to start living like its true.

Your sister.

P.S. For anyone who is feeling lonely or disconnected from a loved one, just know that you are not alone. I am here with you and together we can mend things. If you needed to hear those words, please know, you are loved. I love you and I want the best for you. You are worth more that what the naysayers say and you can accomplish whatever it is your big and beautiful heart desires. I am praying for and with you my brothers and sisters. Praying for families to be mended back together, relationships to blossom, generational curses to be broken, and for you to leave a happy, healthy, and prosperous life and example for the generation to come and show them that you can overcome tragedies that came before you. We all have a past, but how will you let shape your future? Don't let it keep you there, its time to break free and move up the ladder. God doesn't want us to be bondage, He wants us to be free. You can do it. Say to yourself, "I can do it" until you begin to believe it and start to do it!!! I love you and will be praying and remember, God is with you always.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Although, I haven't reached my year just yet, tonight's revival made me decide to write. It spoke on the "Here and Now" and the fierce urgency of the now, so I am taking advantage of my now. So! I thought I had a layout on how I wanted to blog about this journey, but I'm just gonna go with the Ghost and see where He takes us.

First off, I want to dedicate a song to this journey and this song is the very first song I've heard when I gave my life to Christ (2/11/2013) that broke me ALL the way down:: "Dear God" by Smokie Norful. Please take a listen. What I've learned so far is that God is good. I know that's like a cliché phrase, but it is really real. He is more than enough (El Shaddai) and in the very beginning I used to say it, you know, but as time went on, I began to believe it and now I know it. As I look back over this past year, the way I've seen God come in, shake and stir things up, and deliver has been ever so amazing! In this one year alone, it has been better to me than my many, many years living in the world. When I hear the song "Can't give up now" and it says "nobody told me the road would be easy", all I can is say, "Hmph, Hallelujah..tell me about it!" They ain't never lying! But!! If it was easy, everyone would be travelling on it. I've learned that once you change/start living right, people start leaving and throw that at you. I will always hear, "you changed", "you a church girl now", or "boy, you shol not the Danika you used to be" and guess what!? I'm not! And I'm happy I'm not. I used to get upset when people would come at me like that, but now I'm grateful when I hear that because I know that He is working and it is reflecting in my life, because you should know by my fruits; what I am producing and how I am living.(Matt 7: 16-20) Some people would say that my life is boring because all I do is church, school, work, and home; but in all honesty, my life is quite fulfilling. I don't have all that unnecessary drama from being around drama driven people, I don't have the heartaches and headaches from dealing with the wrong type of guys, and I don't have that emptiness or void from giving myself away to people who didn't have my best interest at heart. I would get asked the question, "Is it really that serious?", and the answer is YES!! Yes it is!!! It was that serious when I was out in the world having to be drunk before I can go out anywhere and have a good time, it was that serious when I just had to have him whether he had a wife or girlfriend at home, it was that serious when I was putting together a plan in place to travel to another state and go strip; so answer me now, why it can't be that serious for me to live for God!? All the things God has forgiven me from, healed and delivered me from, I OWE Him to be "that serious" for Him! God is ever so patient with me. He is using His very own delicate hands to patch up my wounds and heal my scars. When I didn't love myself, He loved me. When I tried to kill myself, He didn't let it happen. When I drove home drunk because I knew "I got this", He took the wheel, for all the tears I've cried, He has been blessing me with more smiles. God is doing things that I never imagined was possible. I figured I would just get caught up with some guy, become a baby momma, and be content with that; but He is showing me that He kept me from that because I am MORE than that. I am a virtuous woman (Prov 31:10), I am a God-fearing woman, I am a wife, I am a mother, I am fearfully and wonderfully made (Ps 139:14), I was created in His image (Gen 1:27), and I was NOT a mistake!

I've learned that God is a comedian. He has a GREAT sense of humor. The very last time I said I'm not having sex until I was in a "serious and committed relationship" for the umpteen time, I guess He was like, "She keep saying this but not doing it; Ima show her" and shol nuff, here I am saving myself for marriage! Now what is a more serious and committed relationship than that!? Haha.. He is one funny guy! They don't say "be careful what you ask for" just because. There is a true meaning behind that. The Bible says ask and you shall receive (Matt 7:7-8). I've learned that God is keeper and even when temptation arises, because it will, He definitely has a way out for you (1 Cor 10:13).  I've learned that He is a restorer and all the things I've lost, He has replaced (1 Peter 5:10). I've lost worldly friends and He's given me Godly friends, I've lost worldly desires and He's given me Godly desires, I've lost myself and He gave me a better me, I've gave my heart away and He took it back and placed it right where it needs to be. God is a GOOD God. He wants for all mankind to know and see Him for that. He is the Lord in the land of the living (Ps 116:9).

My day to day song is "Brighter Day" by Kirk Franklin. Every word in that song is my exact feeling. "When I close my eyes and think of you, and reminisce of all the things you do..I can't imagine my life without you, it's like paradise now I know that it's real. It's a mystery for someone to give their life just for me, what you did on Calvary makes me wanna love you more.. I never knew I could be so happy, and I never knew I'd be so secure, because of your love life has brand new meaning, it's gonna be a brighter day.. Never thought that I would smile again, never thought the dark clouds would end, never thought that I would have a friend that would keep me, never leave me alone. Jesus you're my everything, the only one that makes my heart sing, now I know what real love means, its everlasting, lasting. Nothing can compare to the joy you bring, and everlasting love affair. Jesus my life will never be the same, I found someone who truly cares!" I truly cannot imagine my life without Him and/or going back to way I used to live. Where would I be without Jesus?? No lie, I would probably be with a chick and have a boyfriend on the side (can't get rid of the real deal!), degrading myself by throwing it all out and posting it all over the WORLD WIDE WEB (which means "Worldwide" people, get that!) and not living to my best of my ability. I probably wouldn't be in grad school and trying to better myself, because I would just be settling for an average life because I didn't know better and that I can live an ABUNDANT life (John 10:10). I would still be dealing with the same drama and heartaches, trying to mend broken pieces of a unhealthy relationship together. But now that I have God, I know that I can do ALL things through Christ Jesus who strengthens me! (Philippians 4:13)

What I would say to people who wants to find out on there own of this God I speak of and why I am the way I am or do the things I do, I would simply just say, "Try Him". If you've tried everything else and have yet to find that fulfillment, would it really hurt for you to give Him a go!? I mean really, what more do you have to lose??? If you are already down and out, the option He has is to bring you up and out. That's what I finally did. The saved life is a safe life. He protects you, He provides for you, He cares for you, your safety, your wellbeing, your happiness. He gives you peace, hope, purpose, and joy; a reason to keep pressing on. There are folks who are depending on me to keep on this path I'm taking. There are seeds that has been planted by others that are waiting for me to water and there are seeds in me that are waiting to be planted in others. I can't go back even if the devil offered me everything in the world because I realized that worldly happiness and gain is only temporary, but Spiritual happiness and gain is everlasting.

There are quite a few people I would like to thank and acknowledge whom I've met along the way that has truly been a blessing to me, but that would be another blog within itself! You all should know who you are though and I love each and everyone of you for all that you have done and what you are still doing. Continue praying for me as I pray for you and that goes for other as well. I pray that you will open up your heart and let Him in. This work that took place in me can also happen to you. I didn't believe it once myself, but once I gave Him a try, I haven't looked back since. I pray that this has been a blessing to someone and gave them the "confirmation" they needed. In Jesus' name, Amen.

My ending song is "It's not over (when God is in it)" by Israel and New Breed. I plays this song on REPEAT and sing it at the top of my lungs!!!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Let's talk about sex!!!!

Pretty Ricky asks, "Can you make it juicy for me?", Trey Songz wants to be "In the middle", Ciara says, "My body is your party", and yet, God asks and says, "<em>Why spill the water of your springs in the streets, having sex with just anyone? You should reserve it for yourselves. Never share it with strangers.</em>" Proverbs 5: 16&amp;17 (NLT) The Bible clearly defines that sex is between man and woman and is to be saved for marriage. "<em>It is God's will that you should be sanctified: that you should avoid sexual immorality; that each of you should learn to control your own body in a way that is holy and honorable, not in passionate lust like the pagans who do not know God; and that in this matter no one should wrong or take advantage of a brother or sister. The Lord will punish all those who commit such sins, as we told you and warned you before. For God did not call us to be impure, but to live a holy life</em>." 1 Thessalonians 4:3-7 (NIV)

So now, a lot of times I get asked, "What is the purpose of waiting" and I ask back, "What is the point of NOT waiting!?" Why is it so important to have sex before marriage?? "What if you wait and then it be whack!?" Well, if you stayed pure from the beginning like you were supposed to, how will you know if its whack or not?! Hmmm... But let's keep it real. This day and age, all we see, read, and hear is sex, sex, SEX!!! They make it sound like it ain't nothing and it is SOMETHING!!! Sex is wonderful, sex is magical, sex is when two people transfer part of themselves on to another. God doesn't want you to NOT have sex, He wants you to have it the right way! With a covenant, under His protection. Genesis 2:24 (KJV) says, "<em>Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.</em>" Every time you have sex outside of marriage you are leaving yourself open for destruction. Not just in a biblical aspect, but in a worldly one as well. You having sex before marriage is not a guarantee that person will stay with you. Okay, so its good and you continue to do it, but he/she doesn't want to commit and then what? You turn into a bump buddy and you may even possibly feel played because you gave yourself up to this person and they don't want nothing more than that to deal with you. So eventually you get tired of that and move on to the next, now what!? You guessed it!!! Y'all have sex!! Same story, different person. Do you know that each time you have sex with a person, a part of you stays with them and them with you??! "<em>Do you not know that he who unites himself with a prostitute is one with her in body? For it is said, 'The two will become one flesh'" </em>1 Corinthians 6:16 (NIV). SOULTIES!! Why is it that you still think about them from time to time, even without noticing it.?! Whether it was good, bad, or just aiight; they have left their mark and now you can't get rid of it. When Jesus was at the well, He told the Samaritan woman to go call her husband and when she told Him she had no husband, He said unto her, "<em>You are right when you say you have no husband. The fact is, you have had FIVE husbands, and the man you now have is NOT your husband</em>" John 4: 17-18 (NIV). Wow!! So see how that ties into sex and marriage?? If you are having sex, it should be with your husband or wife. So now, I have to ask,  how many "husbands/wives" have you have and is that your husband/wife that you have now?? You call yourself a "Christian" right, but are you really being Christlike?? #Bodycheck #Spiritcheck #Bedcheck

I'm not married so I can't attest to sex IN marriage, but I can attest to sex outside of marriage. Since becoming a born again virgin, and yes, that can happen, I now see why He says what He say. Premarital sex causes so much damage whether you realize it or not! You really do lose a part of yourself each time you engage in it and if you engage too much, you can lose yourself completely. Eventually you are going to feel you are worthless, only good for some joog; and please, let me be the one to tell you that you are not. You are worth SO much more than just sex! Granted, you have those soul ties, but you can be free from them! Will it take time and work?? YEAH! But is it worth it??? ABSOLUTELY!!! As you abstain, strength is what you gain. Confidence, standards, dignity, worth! You begin to learn that those who pushed sex on you and/or allowed for it all to go down really didn't have your true interest at heart, but I can tell you someone who does. God does and guess what?? He has the perfect person here on earth who does as well! Now, I'm not saying that if you're having sex with the person you are with now is not your husband/wife, but if you desire to have a deeper relationship with God and believe that He is calling you to stop living in sin and you trust and believe that He is more than enough and can supply all that you need, then why don't you let Him be that and more for you!?! If you roll over and look at that person who is not your husband/wife and tell them this and that you want to be born again and they say, "that ain't for me", let me encourage you to FLEE!! For Paul says, "<em>It is better to marry than to burn" </em>1 Corinthians 7:9. You may think I'm crazy for saying that because you've been with that person for years and you've invested so much in/with them, y'all have kids, same friends, all in each other's families, combined income, a house, a good lil life going for yall, I get all that; but now let me ask.. Why haven't you marry??? What's the hold up? You have all that going for you and yet you are still S-I-N-G-L-E! Oh darn, what have I done!? Look, I'm not here to judge you, just here to tell you the truth and spread the gospel. I want everyone to be pure and to know Him for themselves. He is "something" for someone! Whatever that something is you need, that is He! My prayer and desire is for your soul to be saved for it is written: "<em>For of this you can be sure: No immoral, impure or greedy person--such a person is an idolater--has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. Let NO one deceive you with empty words; for because of such things God's wrath comes on those who are disobedient. Therefore do not be partners with them" Ephesians 5:5-7 (NIV). </em>

I will end with this: "<em>Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Draw nigh to God, and He will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded." </em>James 4:7-8 (KJV)
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Father God, I pray that the words you have blessed me to write in this blog touches the hearts of those whom you sent it forth to touch for we know once your word leaves from your mouth shall not return unto you void, but it shall accomplish that which you please and it shall prosper in the thing whereto you sent it. God, I pray that we vow to be celibate and submit to you, trusting and believing that what you say is true and that you keep us as long as we are submitting and seeking you. Lord, I pray for those who will take this step after being tied down for so long, I pray their strength in you dear Jesus. You've done it for me, so I know you can do it for them. Lord, I pray your forgiveness on us and I thank you for your salvation and deliverance.  In Jesus name I pray, Amen.</strong></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Aaayyyyeee!!!!! What you need?? I know somebody who got it, for the FREE!!! No gimmicks, no fakeness, all real, pure, in its virgin state. No hidden agendas, its all yours for the taking if you want it and will accept it. It's so good, nobody will believe you when you tell them about this hook up! So what is it that you need?? My friend is willing and ready to provide you with it.

A friend actually inspired this blog. One day when we were texting she mentioned something about having a "connect" and it got me to thinking. We all know that in all actuality, it is not what you know but WHO you know. Well let me just share with you a few "what and who" cases of my own...

What I know is this world wants you to die, but WHO I know is Jesus and He wants you to live and MORE abundantly at that! John 10:10

What I know is sex before marriage is a sin, but WHO I know is Jesus and He forgives and gives you a new life and makes you a new creature in Him. 2 Corinthians 5:17

What I know is "friends" will come and go, but WHO I know is Jesus who will stick closer than a brother. Proverbs 18:24

What I know is people wants you to give up and give in, but WHO I know is Jesus who tells us to pray without ceasing. 1 Thessalonians 5:17

What I know is everyone will try and give you "advice", but WHO I know is Jesus who says beware of wolves in sheep clothing. Matthew 7:15

What I know is people will break their backs in regards to certain celebrities/people, but WHO I know is Jesus and there shall be no other gods/images before Him. Exodus 20:3

What I know is drinking is not a sin (being drunk is), but WHO I know is Jesus who says not to be drunk with wine but be filled with the Spirit. Ephesians 5:18

What I know is people will claim "Christian" and yet still live life their own way, but WHO I know is Jesus who says you will know them by their fruits and when they come to Him saying they have spoke in His name, He will say, "I never knew you." Matthew 7:20-23

What I know is people will talk to and about you, but WHO I know is Jesus and He said they hated Him first. John 15:18

What I know is people will hurt you and you can't really rely on "man", but WHO I know is Jesus who says He will never leave or forsake you. Joshua 1:5

What I know is there are many ups and downs in life, but WHO I know is Jesus and He tells us there is a time and a season for everything. Ecclesiastes 3:1

What I know is people really and truly think they are allazat and a bag a chips and nothing or no one can say or stop them, but WHO I know is Jesus who says man should not think more highly that he ought to think. Romans 12:3

What I know is people will try to tear you down and make you feel not special, but WHO I know is Jesus who will run after that one (you) even if He still have 99 sheep left and rejoice when He finds you. Luke 15:4-5

What I know is people will try to get you "sin" without having paid the price to tell you what you can and cannot do, but WHO I know is Jesus who knew no sin and yet, took upon sin so that we might be saved. 2 Corinthians 5:21

What I know is people will use/say/quote the Bible when it is convenient for them and not pay attention to the other books, chapters, and verses in it, but WHO I know is Jesus who says not to be led away with the error or their wickedness. 2 Peter 3:16-17

What I know is some people are really hard to love, but WHO I know is Jesus who says love everyone as He loved you. John 13:34

What I know, to prove a point, people will swear up and down on "their momma and nem grave", but WHO I know is Jesus who says not to swear by heaven or by earth, but to let your "yes" be your "yes" and your "nos" be your "nos". James 5:12

What I know is that we women tend to sell ourselves short, but WHO I know is Jesus who says "her price is FAR above rubies." Proverbs 31:10

What I know is that these are only a few scenarios/situations, but my hookup, my connect, my bootleg man, who just so happens to be the REAL deal can handle ANY situation you throw at Him. What I know is that it may seem rough right now, things aren't looking too good, stuff just not going right, you're tired, stagnant, overworked, overwhelmed, stressed, broken, hurt, burned, scarred, wounded, bitter, depressed, insecure,  feels like things are only getting worse by the second, saying to yourself, "this just have to be it"; let me just share with you WHO I know. His name is Jesus, Emmanuel, El Shaddai, Jehovah Jireh, Jehovah Shalom, Jehovah Rapha. He wants you to cast your burden on Him (Psalm 55:22). He has all the supplies you need to live life. He is the way, the truth and the light (John 14:6). I can't stress enough how great God is and all that He can do, God is limitless (Psalm 147:5). There is no problem too big or too small for Him. Our thoughts are not His thoughts, His ways and His thoughts are higher than ours (Isaiah 55:9). I remember having the hookup with the pizza man who used to come through the 'hood with pizza and a 2-liter, but you had to catch him at a certain time or wait longer than the regular time of ordering one because he had the "deal", well, this hookup I'm talking bout is an INSTANT deal. You call Him and He will answer. Now granted, it may not be what you may want to hear, but God is Omniscient, He knows all (Psalm 139). This hookup will have you set for life.

What I know is that this world is going to end, but WHO I know will be coming back to give everyman according to his works (Revelation 22:12) and you don't want to be left behind. We wont know the day or the time, but we should and need to be ready (Mark 13:32). Will you be ready??!? Do you want the hookup!?

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So the other day I was saying to myself, "Man! If people were so committed to God and Jesus like they are with these reality and TV shows, the world would be a much better place!" I'm not knocking the people who write, produce, or star in these shows, but I am wondering why do most of all of them have the same kind of concept, and the only thing I can come up with is because that is what the people want to watch and see. I can speak on this because I once was caught up in it hype of a TV show: Scandal. I used to love me some Scandal. Had to be home EVERY Thursday, showered, and in the bed with a snack by 8:58 tuned in to ABC. Posting status after status, heart racing, and couldn't hardly even breathe for at least 12 minutes after the show was over. I was all #TeamOliviaandFitz and was rooting every time he disrespected Millie. I thoroughly enjoyed every sex scene Olivia and Fitz had and was like "Man, that's some real love and passion there!", but it wasn't! In all actuality, Fitz was an adulterer. Olivia was a side chick and blantly, just a piece of a$$. She had no value and no worth in herself, and yet, us girls wanted to be like her. Olivia had the power, Olivia had the upper hand, Millie may have had Fitz's last name, but Olivia had his heart; but who did Fitz say vows with, have kids with (which can be up in the air now cuz we are not sure if ANY of the kids are his), who takes all the pictures with him, be on the news with him, in his corner?? After he's done getting all in Olivia to where does he return to??? Home. And who's there?! Millie. And where is Olivia?? Her place. With who!!?!??! No one!!!! Aaaaah...in yet, she has the power and the upper hand. Dang! That angers me because I once felt this way about myself. "No matter what, its gon always be me and you, you could be married and all and it still wouldn't change a thing" is what I used to say. How freaking dumb is that!? But thank God for Jesus and deliverance!! Stupidity and settling no more! Amen!!

Now the new show that's out is "Being Mary Jane". I can't speak too much on it because I haven't watched it at all and I don't believe in speaking on things that I don't know about. I hear so much about the show though and all the things that I hear is purely disrespectful!!! I heard that the wife of the man that she's (MJ) sleeping with and supposedly is in love with comes and asks her questions about their sex life and she goes into details about it and things and apparently she is opened and okay with the wife knowing that she's banging her husband! Whaaaaaa...... As if black chicks don't have it bad enough, here we go starring black women in leading roles as "side chicks". Like why!? What ever happened to the "mom"? Whether she was a stay at home mom, working mom, or single mom. What ever happened to family? An honest and faithful family man? Do they no longer exist?? Or its just not worthy enough for us to watch and enjoy on television?? Women, women, ladies, girls...we have got to do better!!!! We can't fully fault a man for what they do because WE are the ones who allow them to do so!!! People are going to do what they know they can do and get away with. If he cheats on you and you know about it and stay with him with no consequences or repercussions, he is going to do it again! If you are married, yes that is grounds for divorce, but God can heal and mend a broken marriage. People do make mistakes, although "mistakenly" serving it up with another person normally have signs before it happens, it should never happen more that once. It shouldn't happen at all, but definitely not a two or more type thing. Idk bout that "oh it just happened 5 or 6 times working it out", but that's just my opinion. I'm not married, never have been put in that situation and I pray that I never WILL be placed in that situation, so this is a "speaking on it now, can't speak on it then" situation because I may have a different view or outlook on it if the shoes were on my feet. And if you are not married and you were looking for signs then uh....hellloooooo...that is it!!!! The Bible clearly states marriage is between one man and one woman. Let man be to his one wife and woman to her one husband. **Funny side note, one day I was thinking about like a threesome after you were married and then Sunday that same week, Pastor out of NOWHERE said that same saying about a man to his one wife and woman to her one husband, so he don't know when, where, and how a threesome came about... Talk about CONVICTION!!!! Hello!! He works and He knows. He knows your inner man, your thoughts that you don't share with nobody and He comes, delivering you the answer, whether you asked for it or not! Haha.. Anywho!!**

My thing is this. Watch who you "model"/look up to. Olivia may be good at her job, but she is no role model. Don't know how Mary Jane is at her job, but she is no good role model either. Majority, if not all of the chicks on ANY RHOwhatever show, which I still haven't figured out WHY its called "Real Housewives" or "Basketball Wives" and NONE of them are wives, but whatever, they are not good role models. You don't wanna be somebody side piece, you wanna be the full 3-6 course meal! Why settle for a piece of man when you can have a whole man! Don't you want someone who is always there for you? To comfort and to guide you?? Spend holidays, weekends, weeknights, and mornings with?? Go to sleep every night and wake up with? Olivia doesn't have that. I don't believe MJ has that either and yet we all #Teamgogetyourmarriedmanfromthatwomanhemarried. See, that looks and sounds dumb!!

But get this!! There is a movie coming up and here is the casting call:: Wanted!! Women and men seeking after God's own heart. Virtuous, loyal, proud, giving, loving, caring, kind, prosperous, humble, meek, wise, understanding, serving, worthy, faithful, and knowing of their worth. Do you want the job or you're gonna continue being an extra??? Stop settling, its time to claim your spot! Wait, let me clarify that before these "number twos/side pieces" be tryna tell that married man/woman to leave their wife/husband and be with them. People, listen....if the man/woman have somebody he/she is not your body...GET THAT!! Ladies:: There is a man looking for you, but if you're caught up running behind someone else's he is never going to catch up with you!!!! Stay your lil tail still and be patient!! You're probably prolonging the search. And men!!! Being a "player" is not what's up. Banging all these different chicks, having all these babies, and bragging about it AND not taking care of them is not what's up. Where are YOUR standards!? You're selling yourself short too. Get that! You cry about you wanting "loyalty" and "one chick that's down for me" and yet, you running around dipping and dodging into any and everything!!! Such an oxymoron. Get your stuff together. Quick to claim there are no good women out here and you're the most rotten fruit on the tree! You attract what you are. You're a club hopper, you're going to meet a club hopper. You're a street n*gga, you're going to meet a street chick and vice versa. It's plain and simple. You can't be the devil and expect an angel. Darkness and light doesn't play well together my dear. I pray every night that we can get it together. So howsabout it, are you up for the call???

		<content:encoded><![CDATA["Letting go" is not a noun. It is more than a phrase. Letting go is an action. It requires work and actually doing what it states:: Letting go! In order to let go of something, a person must release it out of their possession and possibly into the possession of another. When a person gets "let go" from their job, they have been fired, released, never to return again.... When you let go, it frees you up to catch, capture, and possess something else for yourself. The more you try to hold on to things, the more difficult it will become to take on new things. Eventually, you are going to have to let go of something. Depending on what you're doing, you make take letting go as a form of giving up, but its really not. It's a form of moving on. Realizing that you have done all you can do, you put your best effort into it and it just wasn't enough and you realized that your time was done. Take tug-a-war for instance. Two teams on both sides of a rope pulling each other, trying to become champs. Your pulling and pulling, with all your strength and all your might, the tug is on going. You get the upper hand, they tug a little harder, and you get pulled back. Eventually there will become some wear and tear. Eventually one team would have given it their all and finally will release the rope. What happens then!? Yes, the other team have the victory, but after the "released team" stumbles back, they will get up feeling great because they have let go of what was causing them grief, hurt, pain, and discomfort.

As seen in the demonstration above regarding tug-a-war, when you release something that you had such a tight grip on, you will stumble back, but do not let that deter you! Just because you stumble, does not mean you've fallen and/or down! Letting go is not only for you, but it is for whatever is being let go. It frees you and it from each other, allowing both entities to be released and opened and available for what may come next. Letting go is freedom, its life, its accepting that you are really not in control and being okay with that. It's refreshing and it allows you to go on with your day and your life with no regrets and no look backs. It's throwing in the towel and saying, "I surrender! I have given it my all and my all was not enough, so I'm letting go and releasing myself to be ready and get prepared for what may happen and come next." I promise, ever since I really tried to stop figuring things out myself, holding on to things, quit focusing on the "what if's", and trying to analyze and think of what I could have done differently, I have truly been able to enjoy life!! Seeing it for the beauty that it truly is. Having breath in my body, blood flowing in my veins, and appreciating the simple things. And all of that is because I have let go! I have surrendered, said, "you know what, I am tired of carrying all of these things, I'm tired, its heavy, my mind is cloudy, I feel like I'm not living and life is just passing my by." I let go and let God. He cannot do what He wants to do without our participation. You may ask, "why not because God is God and He can do anything?", this is true, however, God uses man for His manifestation (learned that in Bible Study last week!). You see, God can't use and utilize me like He wants to if I'm still holding on to bitterness, anger, insecurities, pain, brokenness, people, and unforgiveness. He wouldn't be able to speak through me and into the lives of others if I didn't rid myself of those things and then some. God is love. A broken, bitter, angry, insecure, full of pain and hatred person cannot and will not be able to show love, let alone give love; therefore, God would not have been seen or known because He is love.

Letting go is a necessity. It is what will promote you to another level. It will allow you to empty out some things so that you may be filled with new things. A person or a situation that you are holding on to, may very well have moved on and you are still stuck. Why!? Because you are still holding on. If you let it go, you free not only the situation or person from you, but YOU free YOURSELF from that situation or person and now you are open to allow other opportunities to come to you. So you do have some control. You can control whether you stay or whether you go. You shouldn't have no man or situation to control or have power over you! God is the one who should be in control. He can go and take you where man cannot. It will be hard and may even be a bit difficult, but it will all be worth it! Take it from me. Soon you will be free and feel that weight being lifted off of you. I still have work to do and ways to go. I just ask that you pray FOR me as I pray for and with you. We shall overcome....together, with the help of God on our sides.

I am far from perfect; but I know, that each day I wake up is another day to strive for it. Look, I'll keep it real with you. Its hard, things are not going the way I expected it, I'm alone and isolated, and I'm still missing my grandpa like crazy!!! The upside in all of that is, even though I am physically feeling these hits, I am spiritually satisfied. I am happy, and joyous, and learning to understand the woes of life. This is why I truly believe I have not fallen yet or broken. God is keeping me. He's is building me and making me stronger because of something is bigger than me! I don't exactly know what that "something" is, but it is going to be a big deal!! Mark my word for it. The little stuff that I look back and reflect on, seeing where He is literally taking and molding me, keeps me grounded. It keeps me motivated and wanting to move forward. My life is a testimony to someone, my words will touch somebody, my actions are a visual for people who are looking and asking God if it can be done!! I no longer do things for me, but He. Trust me!! I got two tickets in two days. Stupid, pointless tickets, I wanted to let that State Trooper have it sooooooo bad, but all I could do was smile, nod my head, laugh, thank him for doing his job, and tell him to have a great day. I was so heated as I drove off I almost started to cry because I couldn't "let him have it" and it was boiling in the inside, but then I had to sit back and analyze the situation. It could have been worse. I have illegal tint on my car, he even mentioned it. I KNOW if I woulda went in on him, he most definitely would have got me for that and that" improper seat belt" ticket (no ticket as he put it, blah!) would have been possibly quadruple the price. Then the next day, I walk out of class, I have a stupid parking ticket, what the world!? Now that day, I ain't gon lie,  in my head, somebody got cussed out! Didn't change anything though. So all in all, my little rant didn't change anything. Oh, but when He says your latter will be greater (Haggai 2:9)!!!

The devil gets a text message when God is about to bless you (Pastor said that one day). Satan does not want to see you succeed. He wants you to fail tremendously! God is doing great things this year for His children. This is the year of great things. The devil is coming in full affect, throwing every thing at you, and you will have to decide to stand and fight through! Remember you are not alone. There are Christians all over the world fighting their own battles and temptations right along with you (1 Peter 5:8-9). Look, God doesn't want His people to suffer and it would be really great if you could live for Christ and not undergo anything, but WE were the ones who messed up in the first place, because we didn't believe that God was enough and we didn't take Him at His word. How many of us still do this???? Guilty at times, but hey, that's human nature. Not to mention, Jesus SUFFERED for us, so who are we to say, "God don't let me go through anything." I ain't never put my life of the line for anyone, died, and rose again. I'm just saying. We as a people, we as a church, we as members of God's body HAVE to get better at trusting and believing that God is enough! We have to get the point to where if God blesses us no more, we would still say, "Thank you anyways." God blesses us more than we deserve and if any person says otherwise, they are in true denial. God loved us when we loved Satan. He had His hand on us when we didn't have Him on our last mind. Yes, God washes all that away, but you could and should never forget where you came from, in my opinion.

Each of us have a story to tell. Each of us has a past. That does not disqualify for God's forgiveness, grace, mercy, peace, joy, longsuffering, and love; it qualifies you for it!!!! That is a requirement. He loves the broken, He can heal and mend all of your broken pieces. When all you see is darkness, He is the only way out. He is the light! You don't even have to wait until you hit the floor, you can call on Him while you're falling and allow Him to catch you and/or lessen your pain. Look, I'm not saying it is easy, I'm not saying things will turn around and get better immediately, but what I am telling you is it will be all worth it!!!! From Depressedville to Joyland. The transformation is amazing despite the rough and sometimes bumpy transportation.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This morning when I woke up, "time, time, time" was on my mind. I got to thinking how we humans tend to normally think, "When its the right time" or "Its not the right time" and I'm like, "When it is time, that's when it is the right time." We try to make our own time when God already have everything planned and mapped out for us. Yes, there is a designated time for everything, but we prolong it and/or prevent it from happening.

I hear a lot of people talk about how they gotta get some things in order before they come before God, go to church, or become saved, when in reality, that is most likely never going to happen because those very "things" just may be what He is calling you for so He can assist you and "getting them together." NO one can fill a void and make you whole BUT God. No man, no woman, no job, no relationship, no marriage, no career, no money, no hug, no kiss, no intercourse, no kids, no nothing! I used to think if I had a child, then everything would be alright; that I would have somebody who was "destined" to love me and I would feel complete. Do you know how wrong I was?! I don't have any children, but I have God and this is the most completed and whole I have ever felt in my whole life!!!!! I thought "homie" completed me, but really, he was tearing me a part and breaking me down. Of course, I didn't realize it at the time, but now I can see!!! "I once was blind, but now I see." You know the saying, "Come as you are?", well, I used to use that to justify the way I dressed when I went to church. Now hold up, I wasn't wearing pajamas or "club attire" like some people are pulling nowadays which is not only rude and disrespectful, but says a lot about you as a person; but anywho, I digress! I used to just be super laxed and didn't give it much thought of or what have you and my mom would always ask with that "stank face", "You going to church like THAT!?" and look me up and down and I would respond, "Yeap! The Lord said, 'Come as you are'!" **buzzer** I finally got revelation to that word one day at church. When Jesus says, "Come as you are", He means spiritually, not naturally. Therefore what I'm getting at is that you will NEVER "get it together" and as long as you keep waiting on that, that's the closer to Hell and farther from salvation, healing, deliverance, restoration, peace, joy, happiness, love, comfort, closer to God, closer to Heaven, and all that good stuff that comes along with being a child of God you get. Now, let me go back for a second, if you ain't got it and all you have is what you have, then I am not saying do not go to church because you are not "decked out" enough, no, let me clear that up now! If that's all you have, that's all you have, but when you KNOW better, you DO better. So you may start out going to church one way, but when God comes in and do major things and works in you and in your life, you will desire to present yourself better before The Lord, because His approval and what He thinks of you will matter!

Second to that, another thing I hear and a friend and I was discussing, how folks, males in general, would say, "I gotta get myself together or get some things in order before I make this official," and we, as women, are like, "Whaaaaaaa?!" Has it ever occurred to you, man, that women were created to be helpers/a help meet??? "And the Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him." Genesis 2:18. Verses 19&amp;20 tells how God formed every beast of the field and ever fowl of the air and brought them to Adam for him to name and none of them was an help meet for him, so V21 God caused a deep sleep to fall on Adam and He took one of his ribs, and out of his rib, God made woman and brought her unto Adam (V22), Adam woke up and IMMEDIATELY recognized her and said, V23: "This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man." V24: "Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and he shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh." So peep this!! God realized that Adam was alone and that Adam still had work to do and he could not do it alone, so God made him a help meet. **GASP** No mammal, insect, bird, amphibian, reptile, plant, invertebrate, fish, none of that, was a suitable helper for him, so God temporarily blinded Adam, caused him to fall into a deep sleep and went to work. God took a part of man to create his helper because when they join, they will be in tune. The help meet will be equipped with the right tools to help the one she was made from. Oh em gee! It's all beginning to make sense now huh!? Well, this is what I wanted to get to. Adam, when he woke up and saw her, immediately recognized her and claimed her. He didn't say, "Wait, let me get some things in order before I call you woman, I'm not really sure that I'm all the way together and got everything right just yet, so lemme just hold off for a few so I can get some things straight." NO! Adam KNEW that this woman was designed for him, he KNEW that when he met her that it was the right time to claim her, he KNEW that in order to complete his assignment he needed some help and she was there to help him and he acted accordingly. That second to last verse, 24, Adam KNEW that it was time to stop depending and relying on mom and dad, worrying about and cleaving unto them, but that it was time for him to be a man and become one with his woman to complete the task that was to be done. It is time to wake up Men of God. Granted, yes, we know that Eve "helped" Adam get kicked out of the Garden, but Adam left Eve uncovered for Satan to sneak in... Another blog another day. Adam acted on his "now". He recognized that God has ordered his steps to that very event and he acted accordingly. He wasn't confused about it, he wasn't scared about it, he wasn't hesitant about it, he was just plain and outright sure and did what it was that he needed to do. He trusted his spirit and his heart because he knew that God lived in him and makes no mistakes. He didn't put off or prolong his destiny and what was destined for him. I'm sure it all happened so fast for Adam, because one day he's running round the Garden solo dolo, naming beasts of the field and fowls of the air, and he wakes up and POW, lo and behold, there's a female standing in front of him; but hey! That's how it happens and you have to trust God and what is in you and act accordingly. Its natural to get scared, have fear and anxiety because things are happening so fast, but you noticed I said "natural"; that's not spiritual because God has not given us the spirit of fear (2 Tim 1:7), nor is He the author of confusion (1 Cor 14:33) so you can't say that you don't know because you do.

Now!!! God knows what He is doing. He knows all (Psalm 139). We, humans, don't really know diddly squat. (I really wanted to say ish so you can really grasp it, but you get the picture). I thought I knew a lot of stuff and boy was I wrong about majority of it!! I thought sex would keep a man, and here I am single, I thought kids would keep a man, and here I see a lot of single mothers, I thought cursing, getting drunk, clubbing, showing off my body was the "it" thing to do, and here I see that its all self esteem issues. You see, I don't have it all together and if it looks like I do, its only God. I am learning more and more each day, growing, understanding, being given chance after chance to continue living, striving, and reaching my goal. I still have yet to get a clear picture of what's to come, but I know that it will be for my good and it will be what is for me. I try not to logically think with my mind on how things will happen and turn out because that is when I turn God off and turn me on and I don't have a clean track record of making the best decisions but God does. I have yet to hear Him mess up or cause major damage on someone! I mean, yeah, He allowed Job to be tempted by Satan to where he lost everything, but read how that book end. It all worked out for his good. God gave Job double! And if you're thinking that once you become saved and living right, you will never see "hard days" again, please don't be mistaken my friend; you will. There are different seasons and not all of them are good, but there is One who is good and He is a "good stronghold in the day of trouble; and He knoweth them that trust in Him." Nahum 1:7 KJV. Even on my bad days, they're good days because I trust God is doing things. He has something in mind that I must go through "this" to help, guide, prepare me for "that". You gotta learn how to understand your season, see God through and in them, and seek why you are in that particular season and what should come about and/or what should you get out of it. God is speaking, the question is, "Are you listening?" Are you telling yourself that the time is not right, you have to wait for later or for this to happen or that to happen??? Baby, that is clear notification that the time is NOW! The devil is playing with your mind, trying to convince you that "now" is not the right time so he can have a little bit more time to get you closer in his corner as opposed to walking into your purpose, your destiny, your dreams, your goals, your ambition, your breakthrough, your healing, your completeness, your happiness, your peace. You see, as long as you're running from God, you're running to Satan and he's causing you all kinds of grief, cloudiness, confusion, pain, agony, hurt, emptiness, but he tries and cover that up with temporary joy, happiness, love, contentment by using drugs, sex, alcohol, lust, addictions. Baby, you are not doing anything but hurting yourself seeking and searching for that "right time". They used to say, "Tomorrow is not promised", well neither is your next second. This world is crazy and I would hate to see any of you die without truly knowing The Lord and all of His goodness. It's better to live with Him just as much as it is to die with Him. Living witness. My little over one year now in Christ triumphs my over a decade in Satan. And let's not get it twisted, if you are not a child of His you are a child of his. Know the difference. Light and darkness cannot fellowship together, you can't serve God and still be of the world. I believe it was my Elect Lady who said you are to live IN the world but not be OF the world. Romans 12:2 says, "And be not confirmed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God." You gotta make up your mind now that you will be different, that you are different, because if God is calling you, He called you out to be different. Now why would you settle to be the same when you are chosen not to be?! Riddle me that.... The time is now, the place is here, and the decision is yours. So now tell me, to what are you waiting for!?

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It truly amazes me how fast things become popular and people try to duplicate, yet everyone claims to be a leader and not a follower. Interesting....but I don't know if that's what I want to talk about exactly.

God truly works and move in mysterious ways. It's the little things that helps give you the kick-push you need to get up off your butt, leave your island of depression, and cash in all of your "down on luck" tickets. My brothers, my sisters, eventually YOU have to realize that enough is enough and that your current situation, circumstance, position, or what have you is not going to kill you and SPEAK LIFE! What should always get you going is not only the fact that you serve a true and living God, but that someone else has it worse than you. Not saying that like that's a positive thing, but I say that because you are not alone and what you are going through just very well could be worse. We take things for granted. The fact that we can walk, talk, clap, laugh, clean ourselves, drive, see, hear, dance, twirl, roll over, eat, etc. And I have to get on myself with that because I work with the Elderly and Disable and some, not all, of them are the most peaceful, positive, and joyous people and when I come across them, that amazes me!! One particular person in general had such an amazing spirit and was truly inspirational to me. This person has ALS (look it up), but basically, this disease suddenly comes upon a person and everything begins to shut down, QUICKLY! Well, that did not stop this person from having a life, nor did it cause the spouse to leave (I love that too), and every time I visited, we had such great conversation and laughs. Mind you, this person could not talk, they communicated through a computer. I always left them feeling like I received a bump in my positive immune system.

So bam! This WAS my struggle. I'm a graduate student going into my second year. I am due to start field in the fall (was the summer, but I switched curriculums even though it really didn't make a difference). That's awesome right!? Well, here was my dilemma; I work, full time! But how is that a problem??? It is a problem because although I can alter my school schedule around work, I can't do so much with field. So pow, there you have it; I have to quit my job. I knew I was gonna have to eventually, but I just really wasn't expecting it so soon. The Spirit side of me was ecstatic, oh, but that fleshful side of me! Streeeeeeesssssed OUT! **pulls hair and screams** I'm talking all kinds of things and scenarios playing in my head: how ima tithe, how ima pay my bills, how ima eat, how ima get my hair colored when I'm bored, what kind of life can I have with no income.!? But you see, that's why He tells us not to lean to our own understandings. I KNEW this was something God had planned already. He knew that when He had me apply for grad school. Getting my Masters was not my intentions in life, I was either going to marry "rich" or trap someone and get child support or something. Ratchet huh!? Well that's how Satan would have you. Baby, let me tell you. Satan is GOOD at his job of lying and deceiving. Real good! Look around and see how many fools he got fooled!! And yes, I say fools because that is what you are, that is what I used to be. Don't get me wrong, I ain't perfect, but I am no longer foolish. Wisdom baby... you better get you some and not that "it comes with age kind" but that Proverbs 4:7 wisdom! God has plans for you, He has plans for me (Jer 29:11). As much as I say it, post it, share it, read it, know it; sometimes I really forget and that's where others come into play. This week, I was blessed unexpectedly but a few people. Two people I wasn't even expecting to hear from, but God will use other people to get you where you need to be and I'm grateful to Him for them.

So look, I titled this "Monkey see, monkey do" because of the new hype of "Social Media". The phrase "Monkey see, monkey do. More sex tapes coming to a cell phone near you" came to me after seeing all the memes regarding Mimi's sex tape. I remember some weeks back (70 weeks or so), I reposted this pic of this dude hitting this chick from the back and both of them are covered in tattoos and my exact caption was, "This pic is hot on SO many levels!!!!", with a gang of emojis behind it. This was before I was saved. Now granted, the pic really is hot, BUT that wasn't for the whole world, well the world of my followers to know. Got quite a few likes, but that's not what life is all about. I share that because no matter what you "caption" under your posts, the fact that you posted it, double tapped, and shared it means something about you. You didn't come up with the original pic yourself, so that tells me that you've seen someone post it, so you did the same: monkey see, monkey do. My people, we got to do better!!!! Why must we share and spread such foolishness!? Especially those of you calling yourselves "Christians". Yet we wonder why people don't take Christ and church serious. Well, look at what's portraying Him. A scripture/spiritual post here or there, in between some turnups, disrespectful memes, half naked pics, the angry/cussing vents, empty alcohol bottles, you name it; but we want to say and give God the glory. Well I can tell you, not like that He's getting it. And honestly, that ticks me off!!! So you're asking, "but who are you?" Well, like the song say, "I'm just a nobody, tryna tell anybody, about somebody named Jesus." and not only that, but I am God's daughter because I have been adopted and I take my adoption into His holy family serious. Just how you wouldn't want anybody disrespecting your momma nem, I don't want anybody disrespecting my Daddy! And if you true to your word and what you say, you should feel the same way to! Man, I just really wish people get that. I really wish that people get that God truly is all you need and He supplies everything for you. It's no mistake when things happen to you, good or bad.

Another thing man, we need to watch what we watch and listen to. The devil is soooooooooo good and he uses these things to plant little seeds in you and you don't even realize it. These so called reality shows ain't nothing but his doing and we support it, HEAVILY!! This girl put out a whole sex tape, KNOWINGLY, and you know the first thing that popped into my head was, "but she has a daughter!" That's what hurts me the most. Your decisions affect other people besides you! That little girl is going to grow up, living with that for the rest of her life. Why? Because her momma did not think about her when she made the decision to degrade herself for the whole wide world to see. "But she gon get paid tho!" Seriously!? Just shut up. That is a seed!!! And we are watering it. Do you know how many chicks is going to try and duplicate that shenanigans??!?!? They may not be "famous" for it, but the reality is that the devil is thoroughly enjoying it! He got y'all. With television, music, and truth be told, with some of these preachers/pastors/bishops. You can't name me three good love song out there now or R&amp;B song, a positive rap song and video, a positive TV show; and if you could, you can probably count on one hand how much "playtime" it gets,  yet you turn on the TV or the radio and the most degrading song, video, show plays back to back to back DAILY! We don't see that though because we are blinded and we enjoy partaking in what the devil is offering to us. Do I watch TV? Yes. Do I listen to the radio? Honestly, no; CDs, Pandora, and sporadically my Ipod because its not updated. Do I listen to gospel or watch "church" only? No, but what I do is watch what I'm taking in and allowing to feed into my spirit. In Heaven, Lucifer was called "The Son of Morning". He actually held a high position in Heaven. He was to be the angel of worship, so that is how he know he can use music and TV to get to people. It is no mistake that "sex sales" and drama raises ratings. Apparently we live and thrive for that! So you know what, Satan is good. I can't even knock the fellow on that because he has soooooo many of y'all blinded and fooled! And the crazy part of it all, is that I see a lot of people contradicting themselves and that is what he wants!!! He wants you to be confused, because if you are not truly sold on God, he still has a chance to drag you down into Hell. One minute you be like, "God is this/God is that", and as soon as something go down you like, "Man, I need a drink!" and guess what, Satan is right there like, "Yeah, come, just have one with me. The Bible doesn't say anything about having you a sip or two, just as long as you don't get drunk." People.......that is the BAIT!!! How many of us know that it is hard to just have "one drink"? **raises hand** You're gonna say, "oh, that was nothing" and grab you another, before you know it, you done officially let the devil come in and now he has control and access to your life! Your phone gets to start sending messages, people start becoming attractive, blood begins to start pumping down in lower areas, and you're liable to get yourself in a whole bunch of sticky situations. Oooh, but you're going to church Sunday morning, so everything must be all good right? WRONG!!! The devil is in church too, please don't be fooled. That's how he's getting some of these people. They "see" you claiming, thinking, praising God as well as living it up with Satan so they "do" the same!

But look, one monkey don't stop no show! People, just because you SEE one person doing, acting, and living a certain does not mean that you should DO the same. That "Casting Call" a couple blogs ago is still happening. We gotta build the church up and show the world that Satan does not have the power, WE do THROUGH Jesus. If we grasp that and use what we have been authorized to use, there is no way Satan can have and keep us. Look, when you "see" wrong, you "do" right. Nothing is wrong with being a follower, as long as you are following what is right, and 90% of what is being broadcasted is not it. I really can't say or blog about it enough. It's all on you. I'm praying and I'm praying hard. I ain't gon lie, sometimes I feel like giving up and be like, "Well God, I know," but I truly desire for more people to know!! If I could just get ONE person to "see" and "do" as I am, I would truly be grateful. I'm just trying to live and do right. I don't care if man doesn't understand, know, or like it, my only concern is for God to see what I'm doing, read my heart, and when I stand before Him, say "Well done." That's all people. This is not for me, this is for you and for Him. Because if it was for and up to me, I woulda been threw in the towel! Especially with some these people in the world, but I serve a MIGHTY God who can come and change the darkest one!! Hallelujah! And that is my prayer.

I know I'm long winded, but I am very passionate about this. I really want the whole wide world souls to be saved. Or at least 3/4 of it! I pray that this has been a blessing and touched someone! It's time we start spreading more truth and positivity. Show the devil that he ain't ish like he think he is.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This morning as I realized I am going into my last few weeks of work, God revealed to me that an "end" is only a "beginning". Stop looking at what passed and start looking at what's next. You may feel some type of way letting something go, but rejoice that you have outgrown it. Some things may end prematurely, but even then it was for your good. You really have to get in the habit of knowing God is in control and trusting Him when He tells you its time to let go. There's the saying, "When one door closes, another one opens." Well this is the same thing. When one thing ends, something new begins. A new life, a new chance, a new opportunity to experience something else. Yes, it may be scary; but I'm sure it will be worth it.

You know, not only with my situation with leaving my job, but today as I was scrolling down my timeline on Instagram, I ran across a picture of this guy who was once interested in me with someone else and for a second, I was like, "dang, everybody really moving on", and God had to remind me that very same statement again. Then I was like, "You know what God, you're right! I'm getting married (SOON, claiming it!) and he was not the guy!" Of course He knew that already, but sometimes you really need to hear that confirmation and continue to keep reminding and telling yourself that, because it is normal as humans to grow weary at time and lose hope. That's another reason you really need to stay and be up on top of things as well as monitoring what you see and hear because those things will plant little seeds in you without you even realizing it and next thing you know, your mind is wandering off and your body and actions is right behind in full pursuit! Blah...

You know, sometimes I think about when I actually meet my husband, how would that be. My singleness will end and life with someone else will begin. I will have to learn how to be with someone else. To think not only for me, but for him. Putting someone's else feelings, thoughts, and opinions in consideration. I must admit, that is a little bit scary, but I am ready. I truly trust God that although we will have our moments because no relationship or person is perfect, but it will be just what I need and just what I deserve. I  have came a long way in this short amount of time to where I feel that now I would be able to have a successful relationship, whereas prior to this, I could not. I was nowhere ready to end a lot of things to have new beginnings. However, due to recent events, I see that I really have gotten over the past!! Thank you Jesus! I was nervous about that for a while, but now I see I have no reason to be and I rejoice because I know that Satan cant use that against me to mess what's to come up! Whooooo!!!

Anywho!!!! I am challenging everyone to embrace what's to come. Rejoice in what has ended and enjoy a new beginning. Every night I'm constantly saying "God is up to something big!" and I am excited about it!!! I haven't gotten a full, clear vision or anything on it, but it's the feeling in my "know know" that I KNOW it is already happening. So instead of me spazzing and stressing out about my job coming to an end, I am going to look forward to all the new opportunities with school and a future career this ending will bring for me.

Thanking Him in advance and for all the endings so that I can have new beginnings.

-DanikaKayelle XOXO]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Everybody wanna be first in line for free before 12, stalking the time to be the first to purchase tickets to a concert, camping out to buy a new pairs of J's yet, could care less what time they arrive to church or if they are going to church and that's free and open to all. No standing in line (unless you showed up late, then you have to wait on the doors to open again), no entry fee, no raffle drawings, no first come first serve. Now, let me not forget where I came from. Yes, I was at least the 40th person or so in line to get in the club for the free (always hated paying to get in), when Rihanna tickets went on sale, I was stalking them seconds! I was tryna get Bruno tickets too, but mad people done already beat me. blah, still a bit sad about that, but I never was a shoe fan like that, so can't say I came from there. Anywho! What I can say where I'm at now is a FAITHFUL member of church. I make sure I am there on time each and every Wed and Sun. Do I be late sometime? Very seldom. So here's my thing. Why is it that we go to bat with things of the world, but not with things of the Lord?? Why is it that we can sing a song word from word, but its hard to quote a bible verse?? Now, I am not forbidding you to go to concerts or anything like that, but what I am asking is are they more important?? If there was a concert at church and you had to purchase tickets, would you be stalking the seconds. I mean, I've only been to one gospel concert and it wasn't nowhere near sold out, yet Bruno Mars sold out in like the first 10 mins! (Not knocking him, told you I wanted to go) But why is it that we can promote them so much and not God? Not the Creator of all, the Heavenly Father, Shepard of the lost sheep??? Thinking about stuff like this is always a humbling thing to me and some people may feel that I am over analyzing a situation, but that's just the thing. If you truly don't figure out the "why" you do such a things, it's going to be hard to change when you see that its time to. Then, that's when justification comes into play and next thing you know, we are twisting God's word to suit our lives and the way WE want to live as if we are God!

They say the best things in life are free. You can't buy happiness, you can't buy love. You can purchase things that may make you happy or feel loved, but how many of you know that is not true happiness or true love and eventually that will fade away??? **Raises hand** Look, I love food and food makes me happy, but at the end of my meal, my money is gone, my food is gone, my belly is expanded, and my mood is tired. So now, I'm sad from feeling fat and looking forward to a nap. True happiness, true love, true joy, true peace, that all comes from God. He is love. He gives us joy, peace, happiness. Through Him is the only way we can obtain these things. But you know what, now that I think about it, I retract that first statement. The best things in life are not free. To obtain those things, you have to sacrifice. You have to die to self daily and deny yourself wants for needs. Deny pleasurable things until its time to indulge in them (i.e. sex before marriage). So you don't have to pay monetary for it, but you have to pay sacrificially for it.

Now when I think about a few posts ago, "Monkey see, Monkey do" (<a href="http://danikakayelle.blog.com/?p=58">http://danikakayelle.blog.com/?p=58</a>), I can't help but to think about the church. Ima just go on ahead it type it, the church is a JOKE! We have "leaders" leading the sheep down to Hell and they really seem to be okay with that. I don't get that at.tall!! You, dear preacher, pastor, bishop, apostle, sinner, HYPOCRITE, is the reason folks view the church as it is. You tryna do it for people fame, instead of the persecution for and praise for Jesus' name. It boggles me. Like really.... I honestly can't see how you can stand in front of a congregation and wanna preach in The Lord's name, yet you are shaking hands with the devil everyday!!! You are supposed to be an example, you are supposed to be what the people see and they should see God in you. But no, you want people to see and think you are cool and that you have it all together and that it's okay to do what you want and still preach the gospel. Oh my gosh!!! And now we are sitting here wondering why the world is going the way it is and why people feel like they don't need to go to church and why they view and look at church and Christian folks like they do. And guess what?? I do not blame them, I blame YOU!!! All of you heathens and hypocrites out there teaching vainly. You truly don't know and don't see the impact you are having in the community and in these people lives. Believe it or not, you are a murderer! You are killing these people and damning them to hell. Their souls are on your hands. "Well I'm just a man, should that be on God?" Funny you should ask. "<em>And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ" </em>Ephesians 4:11-12, KJV.  Edifying...hmmm...shall I define?? " To teach (someone) in a way that improves the mind or character;  to instruct and improve especially in moral and religious knowledge", so tell me now, how is that not on you??? You claiming to be ORDAINED right?? Called to preach the gospel, so you are saying this is your job; so these are your instructions. Every job comes with a job description. If you can't fulfill it, don't do it! Just because you can't get right doesn't mean you should stop people from getting it right, but oh  yeah, misery does love company and honestly, who wants to be in Hell by themselves??? Might as well bring down a whole congregation with me! Stupid, sad person. And you know what, I really don't feel any type of way if you feel some type of way because I am saddened. My souls is hurting for lost people. Especially people who don't know because they are not being taught. The church as a whole needs to come together and stand together. The true church is being smeared because of the false church. The false church is taking over the airwaves, TVs, Social Media. Gaining an army of people praising the man instead of God. I love when I see true and genuine people. Where we can come together and have a true conversation on our faults and who God is and how He has transformed us and how our lives have changed. I love when I see people post about God and you can see them evolving into a true Christian. Believe it or not, I love scrolling down my own timelines and seeing where I came from to where I am now. You can see where I truly became souled out. Even when I first got saved, I still was tryna dabble in the world. "<em>A doubleminded man is unstable in all his ways</em>" James 1: 8 "<em>No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon</em>" Matthew 6:24 "<em>For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh</em>" 2 Corinthians 10:3. And needless to say, I HAD to change!! Especially to obtain all of my "best things".

Let us not give people a reason to chuckle at the great works of our Lord, but little do you know, when its all said and done, the joke will be on YOU anyway!!

Love and blessings! :)

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Each day we all are faced with something and the saying is true, "Someone has it worse than you." What I am learning each day as I wake up and move is that we all have it better than what we think.! We will never know what its like to go through certain things, because those challenges or what have you are not for us to go through. Today, this morning, when I got up, I started to wonder, "what if", "what would of happened had I done this", and just now I realized that it doesn't matter. What matters is that I went through, that I did, that it happened and I can't go back or take it back. Over the weekend, my heart was broken. I have to step out of someone's life unwillingly and as I talked about it to others and they spoke on it and I replayed it over and over in my head, I've concluded that it is done. It has to be done, whether I like it or not. You see, I'm really trying to become more God conscious of things and not think selfish but selfless. Everything is bigger than you. Actions have consequences. When you do something, something else happens. You cut somebody, they bleed. Sometimes things happen that you wont understand, but you must trust and believe that its a learning process and find something in that storm you can grasp. There are challenges that come upon us that we bring on ourselves. We may not want to take the blame for it, but it is true. Especially if you step outside of God's will. You may be going through a situation and your trying to figure out all the "what if"s, trying to figure out how can you change it, what can you do to make it better or make it go away? Well, the answer is really simple. Accept it. Admit it. Give it to God. I know I removed myself from that person's life a while back and this is the result of my actions. Another thing  I'm realizing, just because the consequence doesn't immediately follow the action does not mean it is not to happen. The Bible even speaks on that (Ecc 8:11-13).

::Karma.... They say she's a female dog, but if its getting what we dished, shouldn't we be the evil ones and not karma?! I mean, had we not done what we did, we wouldn't get what we got right!?::

Anywho! Tough love, mostly for me. Life does not suck. Certain things that happens in life does. You will not have all sunny days; there must be some rain! It may be a drizzle, scattered, or stormy and flooding, but nevertheless, it ends and the sun comes out to play again! Just because you are saved does not mean you are exempt from trouble or hard times. He rains on the just as well as the unjust (Matt 5:45). Look how selfish that is though!? For us humans to feel like since we give our life to Christ that we deserve to have only happy days. Ha! I really gotta laugh at myself and my thoughts sometimes. Jesus, the only perfect man, had some pretty horrible days. Heck, He was crucified for crying out loud! We get dropped from one person life and sit around asking, "but why!?" **Rolls eyes** We funny. But look, I get it. Some things we go through hurts like hell. It seems like the storm will never end and no matter what we do, how much we pray, how many things we sacrifice, how many times we forgive, it just seem like the clouds are getting darker and darker. Well, it rained on Earth for 40 days and 40 nights, THEN the waters prevailed over the earth for 150 days, and then it was still another 21 days or so before the earth was ready for life again (Genesis chapters 6,7,8). **Scoffs** AND!?!?!?! What are you saying? What I'm saying is there is an end. Your rain may have stopped, but the flooding is still there. Your flooding may have even went down, but its still not time for you to step out yet. Take this time to grow. Take this time to focus. Instead of trying to get out, try to understand why you are in. Instead of asking yourself "what if", ask yourself "what now". Don't focus on the pain, focus on what the outcome can be. Prepare yourself for what's to come. Baby, get yourself a rain coat, some rain boots, and an umbrella and second line all through your storm. Get some floaties and goggles and learn how to swim! But! What you absolutely must not do is get comfortable or give in. Stay hopeful. Know truth. Don't sike yourself up saying everything is all cookies and cream when its really hot coal and daggers being thrown at you! Find you someone you can trust to confide in and vent to. Don't go mouthing off to just anybody and don't let just no anybody plant seeds in your ear. The enemy is out to destroy!! If you are having fun dancing and swimming in your storm, he is trying to see to it that you DROWN! Don't let him get a hold of you. Take control of your thoughts. Redirect your mind. Focus on Christ and the good stuff. It gets better, believe me it does.

There's a reason for your storm. God promised never to destroy the earth by water again. Therefore, your storm cannot kill you. Just as He placed a rainbow in the sky, there is a rainbow being prepared in your life to soon shine. Stay prayerful, stay strong. You can and will get through whatever it is. I'm praying for you. I'm praying for us all. Always remember that you are not alone. <em>"Be strong and of good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for the Lord thy God, He is it that doth go with thee; He will not fail thee, nor forsake thee." Deuteronomy 31:6 (KJV). </em>

Blessings...

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[You ever wondered why you do the things you do? Why you listen to certain songs when you're in a certain mood? Why you always run to sweets to lift you up when you're feeling down?? They say we go to desserts when we are stressed because they both are the same word just spelled frontwards and backwards. Well, that just may very well be true. But what was revealed to me last night was: The more you eat in the natural, you gain weight and you get fatter. After that, you are even more depressed because you've put on some weight and with the weight, it makes you tired, lazy, and sluggish; which then makes you even more depressed and stressed out so you go and eat some more. Whereas, the more you feed your spirit man, reading, fellowshipping, praying, you gain strength! You get stronger and with that you can combat the devil with the Words of the Lord and you gain control over your situation and you feel new, revived, full of energy and you wanna go out, and dance, and share all of God's goodness and the things you have learned! Major difference!! So now I pose a question, To what are you feeding yourself? What are you eating??

I remember every time I was to drive for long hours, when my nerves got bad I HAD to put on Lil Wayne. From "Tha Carter" to "Tha Carter IV", to "No Ceilings", to "The Drought" (all), and whatever else in between. That is what kept me sane and able to maneuver my way through traffic and continue driving to my destination. Then, I remembered when I was feeling sad, down and out, over some guy mostly, I would listen to songs like Keyshia Cole, "I remember", Monica "Before you walk out of my life", Escape "Who can I run to", etc. If I was feeling freaky or setting the mood or what have you, I had Trey Songz CDs in rotation, "Anticipation", "Chapter V", some Pretty Ricky songs in rotation, "Juicy", "Honey", Pretty Willie, "Sex in the Daytime", "Touching it", "4 Walls", and some other jams in between. But what I'm getting at is the "go to". What is your go to? Where is your go to? When you're feeling down and out, do you go to a certain song that's feeding into your situation which brings you even farther down? Do you feed into that anger by watching violent films, listening to violent songs? As a single, are you jamming to certain songs letting it plant visuals in your mind which now have you reminiscing on how they used to hit it??? You really have to think about these things, sit back and analyze, watch your actions and your reactions.

People steer away from Gospel music because they feel its not a daily thing. Well, let me say, I once felt that way. Just give me a few songs on a Sunday morning and let me get back to my Lil Wayne. I remember leaving church one Sunday BLASTING "Cash Money Millionaires"! I wasn't no where near converted, heck, I don't even think I was touched cuz that didn't phase me. People was looking at me and I was all, "I got a b in the back and a oh in the front, one cooking the crack, one rolling the blunt..", jamming HARD you hear! Smh.. But now I'm all Marvin Sapp, Israel and New Breed, Fred Hammond, Tasha Cobb, Tamela Mann. I'm not saying that I never listen to secular music anymore because I do, very seldom tho. I may put on some Monica, Mary J Blige, Aaliyah, Chrisette Michelle, Elle Varner, Bruno Mars, BUT the difference now is that they don't have the same impact on me as they once did and if I feel my mind drifting, its on to the next or gospel. (It's a mind thing and you've got to control it) I can't imagine going a day without listening to some gospel. When I tell you, they have all kinds of messages, inspiration, and encouragement in them! God, His words, gospel! That should be your go to! If you're hurt from a "lover", why "Remember when your heart broke", if your spouse is cheating on you why promote and sing, "He's mine,  you may of had him once but I got him all the time", if you're trying to stay dry, why listen to songs like "Panty Wetter", "Juicy", if you're trying to keep it locked up, why let him put the key in your ignition baby?? Now come on Danika, you doing too much!! Well, am I really?! I get it. When you're going through, you don't wanna hear stuff like, "I just can't give up now", "Your greater is coming", "If He did it before, He can do it again". No no...you wanna listen to stuff and people that's speaking directly to your situation so you can sit there, sulk, and dwell on it even more, thinking that you will never get out of it. But is that what you really need??! No! You need an uplifting, not a down pressing. You need to "Encourage yourself, Speak over yourself", you "Can't give up now" because "Your greater is coming". You need to know that "If He did it before, He can do it again". WHY?! Because that means, you are not and were not the only one. If He healed, delivered, saved, comforted, consoled, helped, blessed, loved, gave, revived, restored, resurrected before, it means that He can and will do it again. Don't remember when your heart broke, remember when it was put back together. Don't become just another sad love story, be victorious! Don't be no "Basketball Wife" or a "Real [FAKE] Housewife of ...", be a Godly wife. One that will be honored and blessed by all.

I really hope this convicts someone and makes you think because the devil wants us to think that it's really not that serious. He wants us to dwell on our situation because the more our situation is getting us down, the more we're not gonna seek God, but worldly things to comfort us and try to get us out and that's the more time he has with us to lead us deeper into sin. The Bible tells us to meditate on His words day in and day out (Joshua 1:8). Now don't be all super religious talking bout, "So you mean to tell me that I have to have the bible in my face 24/7?" NO! What I am telling you is that the Word should be IN you 24/7. That should be your automatic "go to". You may not be able to call the exact book, chapter, and verse, but you can call its contents. You can say, "God has not given me the spirit of fear", therefore I am not afraid. You can tell Satan to get back because "NO weapons formed against you shall prosper." When the devil tries to throw your past and your mess ups in your face, you can say, "Old things has passed away and I am a new creature." When temptation comes your way you can remember that temptation is not a sin, its when you "yield into temptation" when it becomes a sin. You can remember how God delivered Israel even though they turned against Him time and time again. When the devil tries to kill you, reflect on how Christ came and died for you so you can have life. Remember everything that was meant for your harm God will use for your good.

I would suggest when you have some time out of your busy life, to sit and read Psalm 119. It has 176 verses, but it is a good read and a good go to and I just discovered it writing this blog. And always remember the word "go" is in God. So now, what we eating?!

Bless and be blessed.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">...that moment when you're sitting in church, waiting and looking for a slap in the face, but God calls you out and blesses you instead! Yeah...that moment. It happened to me. Sometimes I feel like a hypocrite spreading the gospel, writing these blogs, proclaiming all of the goodness of God and I'm not perfect, I still fall, fail, and knowingly do wrong. But God told me, "That's just it." I am not perfect and I never will be. He knows that, He accepts that, and despite it all He still loves me. He restores my faith and reassures me that everything is going to be okay.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">"<em>But now it is no longer me doing it, but sin that lives in me, For I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my flesh. For I want to do the good, but I cannot do it. For I do not do the good I want, but I do the very evil I do not want! Now if I do what I do not want, it is no longer me doing it but sin that lives in me." </em>Romans 7:17-20 (NET)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This past week, I was talking with a friend, sharing with him that sometimes I feel like I be having an outer body experience. Like I'm watching myself from the outside doing things and in Bible Study, the topic we're on now is "Being aware of the devil's devices", and Romans 7 is one of the chapters we are speaking on/learning from. Those 4 particular verses sticks out to me because it explains my very feeling.  There are 2 men. The Spirit man and the carnal (natural/flesh) man. There is no good in your flesh. It knows wrong, does wrongs, enjoys wrong, take pride and pleasure in wrong, loves wrong. Then there's your Spirit man. The you that's been saved, the you that's been made over, the you that's been set free, the you that's been healed, the you that's been forgiven, the you that's been redeemed. These verses are not an excuse to do wrong, but they serve as truth as to why we do wrong. It's not you that are doing wrong, but its sin that's in you doing wrong. You see, even though we are saved, sanctified, touched, converted, washed, renewed, and all that great stuff, the sin did not go away. It's not your flesh that has been saved, but it's your Spirit man that was saved. Therefore, sin still lives with you. "<em>So, I find the law that when I want to do good, evil is present with me</em>" Romans 7:21 (NET).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now, this is my thing. I personally want to get to the point in my life to where I am automatically strong. Where I don't have to necessarily "mess up" to regain my strenth. Where I, 100 and 80 million percent, govern my flesh. Where I completely stop the devil in his tracks before he gets anywhere near me, because you see, we tend to give him a little rope and best believe he's gonna keep tugging and climbing that thing. I wanna give him that rope and have him to hang himself! My pastor always says, "To get what you never had, you got to do what you never did." So to get that strength, to get that govern, to get that power, to get that wisdom, to get that control, you got to go against the grain. Go against that wicked flesh of yours. Will it be easy, HECK NO!!! I wish!! But will it be worth it is what should be more important. Will it take some time? Yep. And you may even have some doubt right after you take that initial step, but in the long run...you are going to be SO grateful for making that leap. God is going to be able to do so much more in your life because you will be able to move on to new heights. He will be able to teach you more, show you more, bless you more, help you more.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">"<em>For in my inner being I delight in God's law; but I see another law at work in me, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within me. What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me form this body that is subject to death? Thanks be to God, who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord! So the, I myself in my mind am a slave to God's law, but my sinful nature a slave to the law of sin." </em>Romans 7:22-25 (NIV)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">"Delivers": verb, plural, happens more than once. Don't let your mind play tricks on you replaying your wrongs and faults over and over again and have you thinking that "this is it", instead, know that despite it all, God is still delivering through Jesus Christ our Lord! He forgives and forgets...and if He can do it, then why can't you!?</p>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Looking at the title of this blog, it seems as if I spelled the word "love" incorrectly. Well, this is true, but to define the word, I am correct. <span style="color: #800080;">1 John 4:8 says, "<em>He that loveth not, knoweth not God; for God is love.</em>" <span style="color: #000000;">So if God is love then that tells me love is God. To love is to have God <span style="color: #800080;">(1 John 4:7: "Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God and knoweth God.") </span>You have to know God in order to love. You cannot love without God because God is love and without God there is no love. It amazes me how small, simple revelations like that can mean, go, and do so much! You see, God is omnipresent, everywhere present. They say "love makes the world go round".. So to translate that, "God makes the world go round" and we know that <span style="color: #800080;">"in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth" (Gen.1:1), <span style="color: #000000;">and as you read on, it goes to speak on all the other things He said to come to pass come to pass. He did that with love and out of love because He is love! He wasn't bored, He wasn't trying to show off, He wasn't trying to prove anything, He simple was just loving. The Bible talks plenty about love. Loving God, loving others, loving those that hate you, but in reality, that is one of the hardest things to do: LOVE! Why? We know God right? Therefore it should be easy to love because if we know God then we love. So why is it that we believers don't love others? It does not say, "He who knows God for 5 or more years loves", it says EVERYONE that loves is born of God and knows God and he that loves NOT, knows NOT God. It doesn't matter HOW long you been saved, how long you've been living for God; none of that is a requirement nor important. If you know God, you love. Simple as that. Yes, yes, YES! I know, I know....there are definitely some unlovable people out here in the world, but it is not your job to judge or determine if they get it or not, but it is your job to love: "<span style="color: #800080;">A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another" (John 13:34, KJV)</span> . Do you know how many of us "saved folk" who are/were waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay worse then the "worldly" folk that God STILL loves! "Loves"---present tense. I know I've done some dirt in my life to where I KNOW or at least felt like I didn't deserve His love and yet He still gives and gave it to me! I mean, He is love, so that has to be easy right? Nah...that's really hard. In my opinion, God has a hard job and we don't make it easy! We do what's wrong knowing He's telling us to do what's right. We go after worldly things, instead of Godly things. We get caught up in the blessings and forget the lessons. We get saved and get all high and lifted up, instead of remaining humble and remembering where we came from. I really do trip out on us humans, no lie. </span></span></span></span>

I blogged, "What's Love got to with it" (<a href="http://danikakayelle.blog.com/?p=38">http://danikakayelle.blog.com/?p=38</a>), a while back, and the answer is everything. There is God in everyone. Every one is capable of knowing God for the simple fact that they are capable of loving.  The thing is that people are blinded, severely! The devil is making it seem like you can just love certain people and its all good, but the Bible says, "<span style="color: #800080;">Anyone who claims to be in the light but hates a brother or sister is still in darkness. Anyone who loves their brother and sister lives in the light, and there is nothing in them to make them stumble. But anyone who hates a brother or sister is in the darkness and walks around in the darkness. They do not know where they are going, because the darkness has blinded them" 1John 2:9-11, KJV. <span style="color: #000000;">You can be headed in a direction that you think you see what's to come and truly have no idea. As usual, there is hope!! Not only God is love, but God is light (<span style="color: #800080;">1John 1:5</span>); and if God is light then love is light because God is love. Guess what, it all boils down to God, but it can start with love. Love will open up doors for you that has been shut tight, love will draw people to you, love will stop a person from killing themselves or harming others, love will give you such joy and inner peace. I dare not say that "love" is the answer, because God is and God is love; therefore the true translation is: God can open up doors that's been tightly shut, God will give you the right people and draw them to you, God can heal, give joy, and peace. They work hand in hand. They are one; but I dare not take away the glory of God. Without God, love would not be possible and you must give credit and honor to whom its due.</span></span>

<span style="color: #800080;"><span style="color: #000000;">Not that you are God, but when you come across a time, and you will, when its hard to show and/or give love, just reflect on your life and how you don't deserve all that He has done and His love and shake that devil off and love the HELL out of that person or persons! I guarantee you that you will open up room to receive an outpour! &lt;--that was for me! </span></span>

Give love and get love. Know God and know love. He loves you and so do I! You are the reason I blog. He reveals these things to me because somewhere, someway, my words, from Him, will ignite something in someone and it wont be me, but He that gets the glory.! Amen..

Bless and be blessed.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[God created the whole entire world in 6 days!!! He did not stress about it, He didn't run after it, I don't even think He broke a sweat! He knew what He wanted and He just simply said, "Let there be..." They say "Beauty is in the eye of the beholder", and I wont argue that, however, even with imperfections of His creation, I don't think anyone can argue that it is not beautiful! Last evening, I went on a dolphin tour, while riding out in the gulf to go see the dolphins, the boat hit a sand spot, in the middle of the gulf!!! **Pause** Yes, I did TOTALLY freak out, but after I calmed down I was like, "but we're like in the middle of the gulf, why is there a bar of sand here!?" I'm sure there are many "buts" that we say to/ask ourselves. "I workout and eat pretty good, but why is this little pudge still here?", "Majority of the women in my family has some pretty decent, nice sized boobs, but mine are not like theirs!?", "I'm praying, being faithful, committed, and obedient, but why hasn't 'this' happened yet?!" Regardless of what your "but" is, realize and recognize that it is beautiful. God makes NO mistakes! I don't know if that sand bar been there since the beginning of time, or if it just so happened migrated there over time, but what I DO know is that God knew it would be there. He knows ALL that's to happen. Time, location, persons, etc. We do so much to try and make ourselves look good for someone else, but the real question is, "How does God thinks you look!?" Apparently He made you that way, so it must be good! He put that "sand bar" in the middle of your "gulf" maybe so you can recognize that regardless, you are still beautiful. That once you calm down after freaking out, you see that "sand bar" didn't change that you are still a "gulf".

Once we made it out to see the dolphins, there were different ones. We even seen a baby dolphin!!! It was soooooo cute!!!!!!! Well, one of the dolphins, I realized didn't look like the others. This one had spots on it. It was "not perfect" because it didn't "look like the rest".. LIE! I didn't realize that dolphin because it was different from the rest, I realized that dolphin because, to me, it was putting on a show! That dolphin was swimming, jumping, flipping, and playing with the others;  beautiful, and this morning, it hit me. That dolphin KNEW exactly who and what it was!! It didn't seem at all that it cared that it was different. It wasn't trying to compete or be like the rest of the dolphins, it just simply did its thing and interacted with the other dolphins. It wasn't trying to stand out, I really think it was trying to blend, but it did stand out! Why!? Because it was different! <span style="color: #800080;"><em>"For thou art an holy people unto the Lord thy God: the Lord thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself above all people that are upon the face of the earth."</em></span> Deuteronomy 7:6,KJV. See, God wants you to be different. He chose you to be special. YOU ARE SPECIAL!! As a matter of fact, say that, "I am special". Every time you meet or run up on your "sand bar", SPEAK it to yourself that you are special because you are! You were fearfully and wonderfully made and God will use your "mess" for your message!! He makes no mistakes. Everything is exactly where it needs to be.

Do you know when things begin to become messed up, ugly, and all out of place!? It's when WE, humans, start trying to "correct" what we think God messed up! Cosmetic surgery is a big one! Steroids, heck, ima even say WEAVE too! Let me clear this up before going into it. Yes, I have worn weave before nor do I have a problem with it. I am not addicted to it like some people NOR do I need it to define WHO I am! I have never been a big weave person, but I would get braids or a sew in when I'm tired of doing my hair or need a break from it. Or being as when I'm bored, my hair tends to be the one that I "attack" with color and/or scissors, so I purchased and made a wig! (I'm natural) But there are so many women who feels that if their hair not a certain length or texture, that they are not beautiful. Be having awesome healthy hair that they refuse to wear because "weave makes them them". No boo boo.. Weave makes you fake because you are really hiding who you really are! I'm just saying.. I'll even admit that I totally want a boob job! I am more than sure that I will never get one, but my boobs are my sand bar. Ain't nothing wrong with them, they're were they're supposed to be located on a woman's body, but TO ME, they are not what I want them to be. However, God knows they are exactly what they are supposed to be. I know if I had bigger and perkier boobs, I would probably be broadcasting them all over the channel 6 news!! But I realize that my "sand bar" does not take away from my "gulf". I am STILL a wonderfully and fearfully made beautiful woman! You must remember God knows the desires of your heart. That mean He knows the good and wicked ones. You can't hide from God nor keep things from Him. He is omniscient!

This is for everything. Love as well. I truly believe that yes, you do have to work hard in love, but not to get love! You shouldn't have to "make" that person love and/or fall for you. However, in marriages and relationships, it takes work to keep them going. This one guy, I promise, I was doing everything in my power to get him to love me like I loved him. Going above and beyond! Still shaking my head at some of the things I would do to get him to want me, commit to me, marry me, and have me. But no matter what I did, apparently it wasn't good enough, because he is married to someone else. I was very hurt and bitter for a long time, but it was a great sand bar that I had to stumble across. What I wanted from him was what I needed from God and what I needed to give to myself. That's the thing right there! If we put the time and effort that we are giving to that other person to get them to love us towards God and ourselves, that sand bar would probably never be there. However, if its already there, just like the captain of the boat kept it going, that's exactly what we need to do. We will witness that there are still other things out there for us to see.

I'm not gonna say I'm scary anymore, because I've been deep out in the water twice now, I'm still cautious, but I'm a little bit more comfortable with it now--no surfing, snorkeling, kayaking, white water rafting, tubing, or jet skiing solo no time soon tho (okay, so maybe I am still a wittle bit scary..lol), however I have realized that had I freaked out and begged the captain to take me back to land after we ran into the sand bar, I would have NEVER witness the beauty of an amazing experience of witnessing the dolphins interact with each other and us NOR would I have been able to write this blog! You see how that works!? Embrace the sand bar in you, recognize and realize it does not take away from who and what you are! God created you so perfect, imperfections and all.

Sometimes, for beautiful things to happen and come about, all you have to do is simply speak it into existence. You are special. Now repeat after me, out loud, "I am special. My sand bar does not take away from the gulf that I am!" **Repeat as necessary**

Bless and Be blessed. I love you all, but the best love is from God!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Wow! That title.. This ought to be an interesting blog.

First, a disclaimer... I do not know how many "followers" of this blog do I have and to be quite honest with you, it truly does not matter to me because this is an outlet for me and I trust and believe that God will use this, my outlet, to reach and touch those that it is supposed to because that's what He do. I do my part by writing, posting, and notifying.. Until He shows me what more to do, I can't worry bout it.

Now, I steered away from blogging because I am in the process of drafting a book and I don't want my book to be comprised of my blogs (I feel that will be a disservice to the people who are going to buy and read it), and I am in summer school...but believe it or not, those are not the true reasons. I personally know when I have "fell off".. When I am unable to write, get revelations, and/or my posts (IG/FB) become more "selfish" and not glorifying my Father. That's when I know I have drifted away and I'm straddling more than I am standing. Luckily, God has not given up on me nor have I on Him. I still faithfully attend church because I know restoration lies there and sure enough....I have been restored!! Hallelujah!

Yes, I am a Christian, yes, I am saved, yes, I do believe my life for the most part shows that; however, I am human and I am not perfect. So, just like all other humans, I make mistakes. I never want to come off as if I got it all together, because I don't. When I used to hear people say things like, "It was nobody but God", "If it wasn't for His love", "I am here by grace", "Mercy is keeping me alive", I never really understood what they meant, until I actually started living in it! Granted, everyone is here (alive) because of His love, long-suffering, grace, and mercy; but, when you're actually living in it, breathing it, feeling it, it's a different feeling. It's different because you get to see it. God shows you who you are and when you truly see you, solo you, you become THAT much appreciative of it. None of us are worthy of all that God does for us. All of us take God for granted and grace and mercy to play with. My heart started aching when I started thinking about the day God takes away grace and mercy. I immediately became remorseful for all the things I have done. I inwardly fell into shame but wouldn't let it show outwardly, but Isaiah 54:4&amp;&amp;5 reminds me of God's words and promise: <em>"Do not be afraid; you will not be put to shame. Do not fear disgrace; you will not be humiliated. You will forget the shame of your youth and remember no more the reproach of your widowhood. For you Maker is your husband--the Lord Almighty is his name--the Holy One of Israel is your Redeemer; He is called the God of all the earth</em>" (NIV). Hence this share....

I often question myself when I post these blogs, why do I write about my personal life like this. My flaws, faults, and falls for potentially the whole wide world to see and I remember in the book of James it saying, "<em>Confess your faults one to another, and pray for one another, that ye may be healed</em>" (5:16, KJV) and I remember why I do it! It's not about me anyways.. But the thing is we get saved and portray that that's all it is.. You get saved and life is smooth sailings and that is a façade! You best believe when you get saved, the devil will come after you to keep you from going up and people really need to know this! Trouble don't end when you say "for God I'll live", BUT the great news is trouble don't last!

I will admit...I was a bit mad at myself for not giving in. I figured if I thought about it so much and I was so close to getting it, what was the point of not actually giving in.?! The point is this: I didn't give in. Point. Blank. PERIOD! Look, in this narrow walk, there will be times when you trip and guess what!? Sometimes may even fall, but let me show you this beautiful picture: "<em>The Lord will call you back as if you were a wife deserted and distressed in spirit--a wife who married young, only to be rejected...For a brief moment I abandoned you, but with deep compassion I will bring you back</em>" Isaiah 54:6&amp;&amp;7 (NIV) God did abandoned me for a brief moment, and look what I am here doing today! He compassionately brought me back and blessed me with and allowed me to write this blog! Every second I am learning to trust Him. I am learning to be patient. I am learning to say "no" to this no good flesh of mine and I am learning to be obedient. I remember posting, may have even blogged about it, that things sometimes doesn't just happen over night. Whether its deliverance, healing, peace, and even forgiveness. Some things are really sunk deep down inside of you that's gonna take some time to get out. Today Pastor said "keep digging, go deep", and that's what I plan to do. But I also know, the deeper I press into God the harder the devil is gonna try to stop me but just how James chapter 4 verses 7-10 saved my life that night, I trust that it will continue to do so and manifest in my life.

Instead of me racking my brain on the "why I didn't sleep with you"...I'm looking at the fact that I DIDN'T sleep with you. My people, stay encouraged. If you trip, don't give in. If you fall, just stand back up. Don't try to play it off or cover it up, instead just go to God and tell it all! There is no more of a perfect time than NOW to get your life right with God...because just like I stated before, there will come a time when Grace and Mercy will be no more and you don't want to be "still waiting" when that time gets here. And Christian people, you could never recommit/rededicate your life too many times; God IS a forgiving God...we just gotta stop taking it for granted.

Whatever it is that you DIDN'T do...don't dwell so much on the "why", but be secured in the fact that you &gt;didn't&lt; and stand on that to give you strength for the possible next time.

Written from God through my heart with love,

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[...I can't help but to give You glory when I think about my story..!
My God!! God is so good.. I am so happy and blessed to be alive. Yesterday was my 26th birthday and when I look back on my life, I know I shouldn't be here today. God has been SO good and faithful to me since the beginning of time. But from 24 to now..I'm just wowed! The growth from 24 to now..despite my struggles and hard times, is so amazing. I didn't expect a flood of emotions to take over me..I mean, it's tears of joy..but my heart! My heart is SO over joyed that I just don't know how to take it. I don't know how to explain it. I really didn't know how I would feel on this day..I been down..but now I can't help but to look up! So many people are dying at a young age. Haven't even experienced life yet. And here I am, still here, 26 who was once taking life for granted. My God. Favor ain't fair, but it's right. The relationships I've gained..the ones I lost. The smiles, the laughs..the tears, the pain. Coming into this year, 2014, I already knew God was making big moves...but this dropping I got in my spirit for 26 man! I'm excited!!! This IS my season... Things that I've done when I was 25 is all dung. This is a new year..new memories..new people..and a new season. I'm learning how to embrace it all. Excited to see what all and who all God has in store. He is amazing. Just simply amazing. He doesn't try to be nor does He has to be...but He is. And I'm glad I am a child of His..! #Blessingsrunningover #Sograteful #26

God,

You KNEW me before I was even formed 26 years ago!!! You KNEW I would be the woman I am today.. This beautiful masterpiece that You are taking your time creating. You KNEW that I would know you, leave you, know you, leave you, know you, leave you, and then finally come back to you. You KNEW that I would lose myself in the world, but you also KNEW that I would come and find myself in You!! My God!! You have plans for me and they are coming to pass. You are prospering me and not harming me. You're not only giving me a future filled with hope..but a present as well!!! I'm so thankful to not only see another day, but another year in life. You still see fit in me!! In ME!!! You have not given up on me! Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU!!!!! Father God, my only wish is to see many more birthdays to see all the things that You have in store come to pass!

Yesterday will probably one of the many awesome birthdays I have had and will soon have! Last year birthday was good, but kind of a drag because I was focused on my grandfather passing but this year, even though I miss hearing his broken down rendition of "Happy Birthday", was truly amazing! I've done nothing "spectacular", yet, everything I've done was a blessing! If the rest of my birthdays a great one like this..I will be one happy individual.

What I do enjoy about birthdays is realizing that you have reached another year and another plateau so you look back and reflect. You get to see how far you've came, how you changed, grown, and all that jazz. I mean, you grow from being tiny little sperm squirming around in your dad's testees to a whole human being!!! Tell me that ain't growth! I used to hear that birthdays get more and more depressing as the years pass, but as I'm living, I feel like they get more and more exciting!! I mean, yeah, if you're living in the world, I can imagine it becoming boring because you're probably going to be doing the same thing every year: clubbing, but in Christ! You learn that it's merely about the simple things and being surrounded by family and friends. Those who truly love you and care for you. So many birthday wishes brought tears to my eyes. I saw how my "Happy Birthday" messages changed as the years went by. I've seen that I am appreciated, that I am a light in a dark world, that people are actually rooting for me and see things in me. Back in the gap they were more  like, "Happy Birthday B*, what club we hitting up, how many shots we taking?! Where we getting f'd up at!?" I mean at 23, I had people downing drinks in 23 seconds! We had a fun night from what I hear, because I barely remember it. Ha! But simple things like a birthday wish change is what makes birthdays special! You should be doing something each day to impact lives of other people so that when that year pass and another comes, you can truly be appreciated on your birthday. There is NOTHING like love. We don't love enough and we don't appreciate other people and the relationships we have in our lives enough. Then when they die, we have all these regrets of what we shoulda did.. DO IT!! When I went to see Marvin Sapp preach Monday night, he said something that hit me so hard! He said that "every relationship outside of your relationship with God is seasonal." I nearly broke down! I mean, what!? You mean to tell me that the people I love so much will eventually not be here anymore!? And truth be told, they wont! Its called DEATH! Life and death! People I once was talking to on a daily basis, I barely talk to them or don't talk to them now at all. That is why it is SO important to make the best of your seasons and the best of your relationships. Get what you can and what you're supposed to get from them and give what you can and you're supposed to give to them. Stop depriving others and stop depriving yourself. Some seasons are long and some seasons are short!

This year, I wish to make an even more BIGGER impact in the lives of others, whether they are super close to me or the farthest away. I want to be a light showing God off in a mighty way! I want for people to look at me and say, "Man, that woman has flaws, but she truly do love her God!" I just wanna grow older and deeper in the Spirit. God has plans to prosper me and He has a future for me filled with HOPE! Hope is an amazing thing to have. If you don't have hope, you might as well not have faith! You have heard me say it before and I will say it again:: this is only the beginning. It may seem I have been "in the beginning" for a while, but like the analogy Pastor gave last night at Bible Study (yep, I shol went to praise God and give Him glory in His house on my birthday, He's the reason I'm here!), [paraphrased] you don't see the grass growing but when you walk outside you know that it have grown! That's just how I am. Each day, each second, something with and within me is growing and one day, you're gonna walk outside, into the bookstore, library, churches, turn on your TVs and radios, surf the web, and be on your social media and be like, "Look at God! Look what He did! Her grass has grown!"

So again, in closing, I thank you, God, for blessing me to see another year! I look forward to all that 26 have to offer. It may have only been "one day", but I already see the transformation. Hallelujah! And to all of my family and friends and loved ones. I thank you all for all the kind words, messages, and phone calls. I truly appreciated each and everyone of them because you really didn't have to! If I haven't said it before, I'm saying it now and if I  have, I'm saying it again because you can never  hear it too much! I love you and I appreciate all you are to me!!!! Praying God's blessings upon each and everyone of you who have read this blog. Remember:: This is only the beginning. This is my season and it may very well be yours too!! Embrace it.

Selah.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Okay, now don't ask me about my titles because I still have yet to answer myself on that. Anywho!

So I know I've mentioned before how I have great convos and things with God when I'm in the shower cuz it makes me feel closer to Him, going back to the Garden of Eden and all that jazz (I think it was in "Kiss my Awesome, Sweet Self"..check it out if you haven't already!) So yeah. Here I am, taking a shower, singing, talking, and now you might think I'm weird with this one, but for some odd reason I like seeing my dirt from the day going down the drain (dontjudgeme) and I compare it to the day I had, whether it was long, short, hard, easy, whatever! Well, tonight it hit me! How would the "dirt" look if we seen our sins being washed away!?

<em>"Come now and let us reason together, saith the Lord: Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; Though they be red like crimson, the shall be as wool" </em>Isaiah 1:18
"<em>But if we walk in the light, as He is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us from all sins...If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness." </em>1 John 1:7;9

Like how would the bottom of the tub look on your day of salvation!? All I could do was say, "My God!" I can really only imagine! He cleanses us from ALL iniquities! So my bath time from lets just say from like 9yrs old to 24 was pretty dirty! I mean, some days I'm sure were cleaner than others, but most days....yeah! I probably was in the bath tub for a mighty long time! Probably contributed to some of the Mississippi River water! But that just humbled me so much and made me THAT much more grateful! God is a GOOD God! He loves us sooooo much that He says, "No matter what you did (insert name here), I'm willing and ready to look past all of that and give you this good ole bath and clean you from head to toe and forget about it!" Man! You cannot TELL me that ain't love!!!! That's that unconditional, Agape love. I so love Him! Eek! **blushed**

I love getting revelations like this because that's how we humans can relate. God is so mighty and powerful that in order for us to really get Him, He has to bring things to a certain level of understanding. Not saying that God thinks we're dumb or anything, but the way we think is not the way He thinks. "<em>For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts" </em>Isaiah 55:8,9. Plus, I'm a visual person. Like, I know the scripture, I got the gist of it all, but actually seeing the dirt go down the drain and to hear Him say, "Imagine if that were your sins." MAN! Talk about an eye opener! That immediately made me more alert and want to monitor more of what I do, what I say, how I act, and what I think about it. I want my water to STAY clean! I don't want him to find NO spot in me. I want to present myself as a "glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that [I] should be holy and without blemish" Ephesians 5:27.

These are the things that we Christians have to get. Regardless of how He reveals things to you, take heed to them. You should be living your life that at the end of each day, you don't have to worry about how scarlet your bath water will be. Each day, each second is an opportunity to get it together and start fresh. God is everywhere at all times! He never sleeps nor slumber (Psalm 124:3,4). It does not take a Sunday morning, Tues, Wed, or Thurs night at an alter call to give your life and submit to Christ. The Bible says, "<em>That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shall believe in thine heart that God hath raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. For the scripture saith, whosoever believeth on Him shall not be ashamed" </em>Romans 10:9-11. **Disclaimer** That is only the beginning people, there are STILL other things to be done, but that is the start of salvation and your new life. Just like the dirt has washed away from the day and your ready for a new day, so are you: "<em>Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a NEW creature, old things are past away; behold, ALL THINGS ARE BECOME NEW"</em> 2 Corinthians 5:17 (Emphasis added). You wouldn't want to keep getting in the same bathe water from previous days, so why get into the same sins after you get saved!? Hmph..Riddle me that! (He got me on that one, I ain't gon lie! Smh)

As you cleanse your body, note that God has the ability to cleanse your soul. If you're tired of the same "dirt" and you feel like each day your water is not getting any cleaner, try being bathe in the water Jesus offered the woman at the well. I guarantee it is life changing!

I'm praying for you. Pray that this has been a blessing.

Selah.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So yes, there is a song called "I know I've been changed", but I'm not here to write it out nor am I here to sing it. However, I am here writing because I see it!! Each day in Christ is truly a new day. You may learn something new, see something  new, do something new, reflect on something new, or get a revelation on something new; but the bottom line is, there is "something new".

Well, overall, like I said each day is a new day, I have been seeing myself feel more and more free. More happy and more peaceful. Not saying that everything in my life is going oh so well, because its not, but still I feel good about everything because I truly believe and feel that God is in control! But today, something happened, and I can't get it out of my mind. As I was laying down, trying to kill time before Bible Study, it just kept popping in my head and it started to bother me and then it hit me that I HAVE BEEN CHANGED!!!!!!

This is the "something" that happened today. Now, it may not be or mean much to you, but this is my blog and my story to tell. SO! After class today, I went to the lake because I wanted to fly my kite (which I have yet learn to master, but ima get there!) and when I pulled up, I noticed the car next to me was running, however, I didn't see anyone in the driver or passenger seat, so I just kept on going and sat down on a bench in attempt to get my kite in the air. As I was sitting there, I just so happened kept looking back at that truck; it was bothering me for some odd reason, and when I looked back, I then realized that there were people in the car. They were just so happened in the back of the truck getting it on.

Now, this is where I realized I have been changed.

Danika, back in the gap Danika, would have been like, "Ooh yeah! Let me go see and watch!" But THIS Danika, God's child, was like, "Awe man, now why they gotta go and do that?! It is like super early in the day Jesus. Lord, I shol hope they are at least married. Lord, have mercy!" and I got in my car and drove away. I was really sad and it bothered me. I was trying to figure out why this thought was bothering me so much to where I realized that its not a bother that its doing, but a revelation that it has done! I am really excelling in my faith and walk with Christ and that is exciting! I am seeking Him more and more each day. Asking Him for answers, to guide, direct, and order my steps. I am thinking more before I speak. I am being nice to everyone I meet. I am learning to be more patient. Even though sometimes I feel like I'm not necessarily moving anywhere, I see that I really am. I am genuinely happy overall. I really do care about the well being and souls of others. I have put away selfish demeanors. Although it may slip sometimes or I may trip, but I am catching it more and more quickly these days. I understand that not everyone may get this or get me and my life and that's okay, because it is not about them either! It is truly ALL ABOUT GOD!!!!

It is crazy the more and more I fall in love with God. I really do feel like I am more than a conqueror. I know that I can do all things through Christ Jesus who strengthens me and I know that greater is He that is within me. Today could have been a test and I could have fell and resorted back to old ways, my mind could have went astray, and my inbox could have went crazy, but it didn't! My my!!!! I can truly say, I KNOW I HAVE BEEN CHANGED!!!!!!!! And that is ONLY by the grace of God and His keeping power! Hallelujah!!!

Just keep on Lord, I WILL continue holding on...

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[You ever feel like life was just too much or like this dark gloomy cloud is overshadowing you? That was my exact feeling of yesterday and it came all of a sudden! Wasn’t sure what it was, but I just knew it wasn’t right. It was time for school and I just wasn’t feeling it. Midterms are coming up and I have some big papers due back to back and not to mention my other work to do in the field. It’s not much I guess compared to the next, but all of that in the midst of personal life all came flooding through. As I drove home from school I just started praying. Asking God what was this and why all of a sudden. Asking Him what can I do and how can this be diminished. The story of Martha and Mary in Luke chapter 10 came to me. Martha received Jesus in her home and was preparing things and serving Him whereas her sister, Mary, was sitting at Jesus’ feet hearing His word. Well, Martha got a lil agitated at what she was doing and questioned Jesus as to why He’s not telling Mary to help her serve Him and His response was SO Jesus! He said, “<em>Martha, Martha, thou are careful and troubled about many things: But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her</em>” Luke 10:41-42, KJV. Those two verses alone helped me feel better about my day and my night. I can just hear Jesus answering my questions saying the same thing: “Danika, Danika”. What I love about the 5 verses from when Martha receives Jesus into her home and Him answering her is that you can see how life happens. We accept Jesus in our lives and get so focused on serving Him and doing what is needed to be done that we sometimes forget to be like Mary and SIT at Jesus’ feet and hear His word. He said “<em>but one thing is NEEDFUL</em>”. It’s one thing to actively seek and hear the word, go to church, and fellowship one with another and it’s another thing to actually sit and do nothing but listen. We all are Martha in a sense. We get caught up in the things of our life and may look over and notice how the next person is doing nothing and wonder, “Well what’s up with that?!” and we go to Jesus like, “Lord, You don’t care that I’m doing all this?” and He has to shake His head and call out our name twice!! Now, for Him to do that, I can just hear the disappointment in His voice. The Bible in Galatians 6:9 tells us to “<em>not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not</em>”. So yes, we will get weary and overwhelmed, it’s no secret, however; we must not faint. When life seems to be taking a toll, it is time to be more like Mary and sit. I know the song says to “just stand”, but I think I may have to remix it to tell folks to sit and listen. I know graduation is coming near and I’m not giving up on that! But in the midst of it, I gotta remember to sit.

So in closing, the message I have receive and that I am sharing with you is before you go to God questioning Him what’s up with you and all this work and trouble you are going through, remember Mary and take a seat. I’m sure the Lord will come and comfort you: “<em>Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest</em>” Matt 11:28, KJV. He said it in His word, so He is obligated to do it. After all, not to mention, He is THEE most greatest comforter there is.! So sit and do not faint, your reaping is coming!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I am just inspired!!!! I don't know where this blog is going to go, but prayerfully it will go somewhere!!!

There is always so much stuff going on. Stuff with you personally and stuff with life in general to where it gets so easy to get sidetracked. I now see why the Word tells you to Seek the Lord and to meditate on His Word. You have to be on your toes at all times because you just never know when something will hit you! It doesn't necessarily have to be something bad, it can be something simple as new. New things can be scary because you've never experienced them before, however, when you are in tune with the Father and you KNOW He is Ruler of all and has your best interest at heart; new things become less scary and more interesting and intriguing. You begin to know that there is a lesson or a blessing. You begin to know that if its a test, there will be a testimony. I used to wonder why I was being tested in one particular area seemed like ALL the time and I remembered my Pastor saying that "God is testing your integrity. He is trying to see if He can trust you with what is to come." I also had to realize that I wasn't as "moved passed" as I thought I was; that they were still some ways to go. That is why you should always remain humbled as well because you just never know when you will be faced with something, knocked back down, or be used to be an inspiration or an encouraging word for someone else.

Tonight at Bible Study, Pastor spoke upon revelation and information, and it got me thinking. I was scrolling down my timeline and ran across a picture somebody posted of themselves saying #workinghard or something along those lines and it was right then when it hit me! We do not take the time to enjoy and dwell in the now. The information that we are giving out is not always necessary or useful! I will admit, I was that girl that ALWAYS had to take a picture of her food and post it. Really, whatever I was doing, I darn near had to post it...: #gettingdressed, #onmywayout #lookwhatimeating #sleeping #lookwhatimwatching #studying #readingforschool. (Now how many of y'all know that reading and studying was not legit!? I got so sidetracked with scrolling, it was ridiculous!) But it was like I was living my life for other people and not for myself or enjoying it with the person that I am sharing my time with. But having my mind constantly renewed and conditioned, I came to realize that who cares besides God, me and whomever I'm out eating with what we are having for dinner or who cares what I am actually doing at this present time in moment?! If we wanted the whole world to know, we would have invited them! Now, I'm not knocking the people who want to have the "memories". Yes, I know memories are more important. My thing is if you are SO busy creating the memory and enjoying it, 9xs out of 10, there will be no time to snap it up, make a collage, and post it; because in that moment, is when you stop enjoying and creating.

Just think with me for a second. You're at a birthday party, no better yet, I will use my past life. One time I was out at a party or at a club or something and I REMEMBER having thee time of my life, HOWEVER, there were NO pics to justify that because I/we were having so much fun enjoying and living in the moment to where there were no time to be like, "hollup, take my picture". Do you know how many poses and takes you gotta do once you take that first one?! It is very TIME CONSUMING!!!!

No, I am not knocking you, take your picture boo boo if that's what you want to do. All I'm saying is do not let that consume you. If you are soooo busy doing what you're doing, to where do you get the time from to take a picture, upload, filter, comment, hashtag, and post it??? Imjussayn. Don't let life pass you by getting hung up on useless things. Man's validations don't count anyways, they blink and might miss it, but God sees all. Time waits for no man, so enjoy it while it is a leisure. It shall end one day and you don't want to sit back saying, "man, I wish..."

-DanikaKayelle XOXO

PS. Am I saying that I no longer take pictures when I go places whether it be of the food or the travel or the act? No. What I am saying is that once, it consumed me as if I HAD to do it. Now it is more of a mind conscious thing to where it is not necessary because I am enjoying the moment. I rather look back and say, "Awwwwe, I wish I would have gotten a picture" than saying, "Hey look at this picture!" and not have any other significant value of the event; that is all.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This week was a marvelous week! From Sunday until now. If you were to ever just take the time out in your life and analyze all of your situations, if you were to just forget about what you are going through and what you are in need of, and just reflect, I can pretty much guarantee you that you will be amazed! This past Sunday, during the sermon, my Pastor said something that just sparked and made me analyze. He said: "God edited your life". In other words, you have done some stuff, but God went in and either backspaced, added a conjunction and turned it around, or added a little there and took away a little here. So whatever your outcome should have been, God intervened on your behalf and edited it!!! Ha! Ain't He good?! Not that any of us deserve Him. My pastor also mentioned something else. Being as I am not the one who like to travel down Past Road often, I had to take a little visit there to write this blog because of so. In order for me to help someone and inspire someone, this must be God ordained &gt;first&lt; and it must speak and relate to that person. Now my story is not your story and your story is not my story, however, the thing we have in common is that WE have a story!!! So let me go head on and inspire you!

God can and God will edit your life if you let Him!!! The things I have seen God do not only in my life but in the lives of other believers around me is just amazing and I know that nobody BUT Him could have done it for me because I tried other things and NONE of them worked UNTIL I tried God!!!
<p style="text-align: left;">Without God edits in my life, this webpage would be non-existing because I would not have been delivered. The edits deliver you! Being born again is like a manuscript. God wrote out your life. He already knows the ins and outs. How you're gonna live and how you are going to die, HOWEVER, God STILL has the pen! <em><strong>So even though He has already written it, He is still currently writing it</strong>!</em> Ain't God amazing?!</p>
Look, bam. God wrote out my life. He wrote out my sexcapades, my drinking, my partying, my lying, my cussing, my depression, my suicidal thoughts, my insecurities, my strongholds, my soulties, all; He wrote them out. Now peep this. That was written already, therefore that was bound to happen just as it did, but this is where God is amazing. I came to Him, lost, broken, battered, angry, just a hot steamy mess and guess what God did??!?!? He got to editing. God said, "You know what Danika, yeah, you had sex, but Ima edit that and make you pure, you used to enjoy going out to the clubs, but Ima go on ahead and edit and put "church" in the place of "club", you used to enjoy lying for no reason, but now Ima edit that and give you the Spirit of truth, you used to enjoy drinking, but Ima edit that and say you enjoy being drunk in the Spirit, you wanted to end your life, but Ima edit that and give you new life, you was depressed and insecure, but Ima edit that and give you joy and confidence, you was caught up on the wrong things and the wrong people, but I'm just going to edit and take that away and give you Me and people and a man after my own heart." Deliverance is real. Salvation is real. <strong>THIS is real</strong>! The edit is real!

You can try over and over again to do it your way. I was probably like the queen of repressed memory! I would do something and the next minute be like, "Who? I did that?! No, not me. You got the wrong one." Be lying and really forget it ever happened! Smh. BUT GOD!!!!! Just how He edited my life,<strong> HE CAN DO THE SAME FOR YOU!!!!!</strong> Give your life to God. GIVE. I like how one pastor put it. He said, "When you give your life to God, that's exactly what you have to do: GIVE---YOUR LIFE.....to God." Not parts of it, not just the parts that hurts, not just the parts that you stand in need of, not just the selfish parts, but ALL! The good, the bad, the ugly, and the pretty.

Does the edit happens over night?? I believe it happens immediately, however, the manifestation may not be seen right away, but let me say this:: <strong>DO NOT GET DISCOURAGED MY FRIEND</strong>. Even AFTER I got saved and AFTER the edit took place, I STILL struggled with some things that was a part of the edit, BUT what God says is what's going to happen. So even though I was struggling did not mean that God edits were wrong. {{<em>God is not a man that He should lie.</em> Numbers 23:19}}

You may be sitting there reading this, broken, lost, battered, beat down, heavy burdened, drunk, high, depressed, shacking up, fornicating, stripping, pimping, prostituting, fakely enjoying your life thinking "this must be it". Let me tell you, I did not think I would amount to anything. I thought that I would always have to settle for second best and always be the lil side piece, BUT GOD EDITED MY LIFE!!!!!! And after each encounter with the Lord, I am more and more inspired to help others who are at the very same place I was in. Only God can turn a "hoe into a housewife" not man; however, deliverance, edits, must take place. Otherwise, you will be rewriting the same lines over and over again.

So how about it?? If you want your life to be edited, you want your life to turn around. You're ready to be victorious, to be the head and not the tail, above and not beneath, to be more than a conqueror. You're ready to proclaim that NO weapons formed against you shall prosper, right now, after reading this post, go to God and say, "Lord, have your way, take the pen and edit away" and I DARE you to mean it. No, I double dog, triple and quadruple dare you to mean it and watch how the Lord move in your life. Watch how all your edits begin to manifest. I'm already excited for you! Just one thing I ask of you, while you are busy enjoying your new life (cuz you will get a bit caught up in the excitement, but God will bring you back and remind you if needed...stay humbled my friend, stay humble), don't forget to share with others because like the other thing my pastor said, "sometimes you have to let people know so they can see". How can someone else know that their life too can be edited if you don't let them know and give them examples and proof.?!
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>God is not some secret that you wanna keep to yourself, God is SO amazing that you are going to WANT to share Him with everyone else!!!</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
Hallelujah! Be blessed and let the edits begin Lord!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Hello there!!!!! :)

You know, each encounter I have with God, I begin to side-eye a lot of people who say they know God. Now, I'm not here to judge, that's not my job, but each encounter with God, I feel better than I have before. I feel renewed and rejuvenated! Thoughts that shouldn't have been there, diminished, things that I don't do anymore, I wanna make sure I keep it that way.

I'm not gonna say I know the Bible front and back because I don't, however, I DO know that every----EVER-REE----encounter someone had with God/Jesus SOMETHING WAS CHANGED and they were made the better.

Peep:: If you "know" God like you say you do, then you know what He likes and what He dislikes. You know what He says to do and what He says NOT to do. You know what's on limits and what is off limits. You know Him right, therefore; you are saying you know this. Now. If you truly know God and had an encounter with Him, then why is it that you do the same things that YOU want to do???? Couldn't have been that much of an encounter, nor a relationship if you ask me. Speaking of relationships:
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Relationships are give and take. So what makes you think a relationship with God would be any different????</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
Anywho!!! Let's take a look through the Bible and evaluate your/our relationship with God. Now, I am SUPER convinced that if we are not to be changed or made the better after we meet and know God then it would not be mentioned throughout the Bible. This is my blog and that is my 7 copper pennies. From Jesus' birth until Jesus' death, there were numerous of encounters and quite a few relationships. We all know about the woman with the issue of blood (Mark 5:25-34), she touched the HEM of His garment and was instantly healed. After admitting it was she who touched His garment when He asked, He told her to, "<em>Go in peace and be whole of thy plague</em>" (V34). See!!! There was a change and she was made the better!! Next, you have the man on the stretcher being carried by some men who lowered him down from the ceiling to have an encounter with Jesus and can you guess how that encountered ended??? With the man WALKING out! Ha! Hello!!!!! Let's not even talk about a human encounter, Jesus first miracle, turning water into wine (John 2:1-11). Objects even change when they have an encounter with Jesus! I can go on because there are plenty more, but I'm going to move forward.

I know that everyone has their own personal relationship with God and I respect that; however, I personally can't see how someone can say that they know God and have a relationship with them, yet, NOTHING in their lives has changed! Not their personality, not their circumstances, not their walk, their talk, their dress, their mouth, their actions, NO-THING!!!! Clearly, there is no encounter there. We just saw three instances above where it shows differently and I am also going off of my own personal  experience.

Look, when you truly get to know God, your eyes will be OPENED! Like wide opened like an owl and those 2 emojis, you know the yellow face with the bucked eyes on the first page and the 2 googley eyes on the 5th page; I digress. But you will begin to change your life because you are going to want to spend more time with God, so you're not gonna be able to watch that tv show, or hang out with that friend to gossip all day. You're gonna start weaning off of things slowly but surely, why?! Because your direction has shifted! Your focus is new. When you know God and have a relationship with Him, your mouth gon change, your attitude gon change, your walk gon change, your actions gon change, your habits gon change, your thoughts gon change, your style gon change, <strong>EVERYTHING IS GOING TO CHANGE!</strong> You're gonna stop cussing, you're gonna stop talking down to others, you're gonna stop speaking negative, you're gonna stop entertaining drama, you're gonna stop have premarital sex, you're gonna stop clubbing, you're gonna stop drinking and getting drunk, you're gonna stop  drugging, you're gonna hoeing, you're gonna stop showing the world what's God (your body), you're gonna stop watching and entertaining foolishness. When you have an encounter with God, a relationship with God, you are going to be changed! Why?! Because that is what God is, that is what God do. He changes things: people, circumstances, things.

So like I said, after each encounter I have with God, I begin to side eye some people who say they have a relationship with God; and yes, I do check myself to see what else can and needs to be changed, because I want to be more like Him. I'm awesome, but He is WAAAAAAY more awesome than me! Imjussayn. So howsabout we all just take a moment and evaluate ourselves and our life and sincerely ask ourselves: "Do I really know God and do I really have a relationship with Him?" Let a moment happen where things begin to flash in front of your eyes and then honestly answer yourself. If the answer is no, change that! If the answer is yes, make it better. We could never stop growing and getting closer to God and stopping should never be an option.

I love God, I love you, but what is soooooooooo much better than that is that He loves us all....EVEN MORE!!!!!!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So today as I was driving, I realized I couldn't see through my glasses. They were all cloudy and dusty and things, so I took my cloth out and cleaned them, and the Holy Spirit spoke to me and said, "That's what you need to do with your spiritual lens" and I was like WOW!!!! I wear my glasses everyday, not realizing that each day, there can be pile up that I just cant see until one day, like today,<strong> it is CLEAR that it is not clear</strong>. Get it?! Well, that's just how our spirit lives are. We be in the spirit every day to where we don't realized that on each new day, we take on something new that adds pile up to our lens, and then one day, pow! We are overwhelmed and wondering where this "cloud" is coming from!? I am here to tell you to do what the Holy Spirit said when I cleaned my glasses: clean your spiritual lens. Take a moment and go to God and ask Him to help you see clearly again.
<p style="text-align: left;">It's okay to become overwhelmed and consumed with a lot of things, we are humans, however, we must not forget Who take cares of our cares:</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">"<em>Casting all your care upon him: for he careth for you." 1 Peter 5:7 (KJV) "</em><em>Cast thy burden upon the Lord, and He shall sustain thee: He shall never suffer the righteous to be moved." Ps 55:22 (KJV)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">God is here to give us rest. "<em>Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke on you and learn from me, because I am gentle and humble and in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy to bear, and my load is not hard to carry" </em>Matt 11:28-30 (NET). He is here to sustain you, to support and strengthen you. "<em>The Lord is the strength of His people, a fortress of salvation for His anointed one" </em>Psalm 28:8 (NIV). It's no mistake these verses are here. The Lord knows with the ills of life, that we will be overwhelmed. That is a part of why He sent His Only Begotten Son. Jesus says to<em> take His yoke and learn from Him</em>. He is equipped to carry the weights of it all, not us.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Am I saying to live life without a care in the world? Absolutely not!! I can't continue on with my days without putting my glasses on, so no, that is not what I'm saying. What I am saying is to do what you need to do, care for those you need to care for, do your work that you need to do, make that move you've been meaning to make; but as you do your tasks, just remember to clean your lens. <strong>Don't let the clouds come in and block your vision</strong>. One of Satan's goals to get us is to blind us. That is why the Holy Spirit said to "clean your spiritual lens". Satan wants to get your glasses so dirty that you lose sight and lose focus on your ultimate goal: Christ. Why do you think when trouble comes, you want to break down and indulge and unhealthy things (i.e. alcohol, drugs, gluttony with food, sex) and your mind begins to wander off and go haywire!? It is no coincidence my dearie. No, no. So when you begin to see the clouds making themselves visible in your life, take your glasses off, present them to God, and let the cloth of the Holy Spirit clean them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Father God,
</em><em>We thank You for Your sweet and precious Holy Spirit. Lord, we come to You with our cloudy and plied up glasses asking You to cleanse them so that we may see again. God, we know that the ills of life are going to come, but we pray, that as we go on with each day, we remember to check our vision so that Satan cannot come in and have any type of rule over us. Lord we pray that Your Holy Spirit never depart for us and God, You said that we shall never suffer to be moved, therefor God, we come to You Father, casting all of our burdens onto You because we know and understand that we cannot do it on our own. And Father, we thank You now that it is already done and that we can see clearly now that the clouds are gone.
In Jesus precious and awesome name we pray, Amen. </em></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">Bless and be blessed...</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Yowzers!!! Yes, ripping off of the Band-Aid can be painful and hurt, but what if I told you that you have to <strong>HURT</strong> in order to<strong> HEAL</strong>?! Yep! That's right. You wont need healing if there is no hurt. Duh!! God has been moving and speaking and after tonight's bible study, He has confirmed and convicted! Not all things will be to your liking. There is a time and a season for all. A time to weep and a time to laugh, a time to say "hi" and a time to say "goodbye", and at the end of it, you have to count it all joy! Why!? Because we must remember that "W<span class="st"><em>e know that <strong>all things work together for good</strong> to them that love God, to them who are the called according to His purpose</em>." Romans 8:28, KJV. If God brings you to it, He will bring you through it!</span>

God is a protector and we hurt ourselves by being in dead relationships, or we have been hurt by others physically, mentally, and/or emotionally and guess what!? IT'S OKAY!! Forgive. Let go. It is time to heal. These are the exact words my Pastor said tonight at Bible Study (12/3/14) that made me not only confirm a closed and final chapter to a book, but to take it off the shelf and toss it into a fiery furnace!! "There's only so much crying you can do about something. Don't try to get God to cry with you. Know how to move on. Take your negative things and take that as a lesson, a stepping stool. Yes, negative things can be a lesson. If the do not become a lesson, you are going to repeat them. They MUST become a lesson." -Pastor Tracy Casby, Sr., Full Life Faith Ministries. That lesson just may very have been your blessing!! Learn how to recognize those things, pray and ask God for discernment and for Him to open up your eyes.

There's a meme I ran across that says: "The bad news is: Nothing lasts forever. The good news is: Nothing lasts forever." How awesomely great is that?!?! You see, that pain will go away. Just like ripping off a Band-Aid, yes, initially it will hurt, but once you get over the shock of it and your wound is no longer hidden, you will begin to see your healing process! Hallelujah! God is a healer, Jesus came to heal all! Not just from physical ailments, but from deep down, down in you belly, heart wrenching, "I will never love again", "I am not beautiful", "I am nothing", emotionally scarred hurt. I know when I was a kid, I loooooved Band-Aids!! (Don't ask) I used to scratch myself, pick scars, or just make up booboos just so my mama could give me a Band-Aid, (but I was scared of shots, go figure! Blah) Anywho!! My point is, just like me as a kid, some of us like to pick at old wounds (go back to the past) or create new ones (staying when we should go) because we got used to having on Band-Aids, we liked the idea of being patched up because we didn't have to look at our wounds since they were covered. But it is when you take that Band-Aid off when you begin to truly get back to normal.
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Don't let past hurt hinder your growth.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">A past "love" hurt you!? So what?! Rescramble those letters in "hurt" and turn them into "Ruth" and know that your Boaz is down the road! Ruth was definitely hurt. She lost her husband and left everything she had known to follow her mother-in-law into a new town. You can't tell me that wasn't a tough Band-Aid to rip off!! But look what came out of that rippage.! Don't give up. God can supply ALL. He can provide your spouse in the midst of this man drought (or woman drought for you men reading). Quit washing around the Band-Aid trying to keep it intact and don't try to take it off slowly because honestly, that hurts more. Rip that sucker off, cry, scream, yell until you are gasping for air if you have to; but most importantly, heal and receive your breakthrough.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is possible. Believe you me, but most importantly, believe that for yourself. I am a living witness to the miracles and works of God. To His awesome healing and protecting power. The scar(s) may still be there, but they are no longer covered; they're free.</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Be free.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">That is my prayer for each and everyone of us. Bless and be blessed.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In the spirit of Christmas, its only right my gift to you be a message of Christ! :)

In our last Heart to Heart, the theme was "Stirring up the Gifts". Gifts...not your talents, but your gifts. My very first blog [<a title="Destiny, Purpose... What is it? What's my gift???" href="http://danikakayelle.com/destiny-purpose-what-is-it-what-is-my-gift/">http://danikakayelle.com/destiny-purpose-what-is-it-what-is-my-gift/</a>] was on gifts. How they can be so many different things!! She, my First Lady, talked about the gift ALL born again believers have to share: Faith, Hope, and Love (she spoke from 1 Cor 12 and 13). But the one that really touched me was the gift of Christ through our testimony. So I will share my story of Christ and how He changed my life in hopes to give faith to the faithless, hope to the hopeless, and love to the unloved.

Some people see me and see the things that I DON'T do anymore. Some people see me and see the things that I do now. And some people, well, let's just say that they just don't see me. What I had a hard time coming to the realize is that sometimes WE (believers, people who are part of the Church, in Christ, Christians) may possibly be the only Jesus that other people see. So I had to get a revelation on that to understand it. When I first came into Christ, I still thought it was okay for me to have a drink here and there, every now and again, long as I'm not indulging in it and getting drunk, I'm good and Biblically, I wasn't doing anything wrong: Ephesians 5:18 says "<em>Be not drunk with wine, wherein in excess; but be filled with the Spirit</em>"; HOWEVER, the Spirit told me that it is all about image and He asked me, "How would it look if someone came in and recognized you from being 'that girl who always posting and talking bout Jesus' with your glass in front of you?" Me being me, I was like, "But it's only one drink" and He told me, "Yeah, but how would they know that?! All they see is you sitting at a bar with a glass in front of you. They don't know how long you been there or what number you are on, all they are going to see is a girl who talks and post about Jesus posted up at a bar with a drink in her glass and think its okay for them to do the same. Is that the image of God you want to give off? Is that the Jesus you want introduce to people??" Let's say from that day on, she, me, her, I have never put another glass of an alcoholic beverage to my mouth again after that!! Everyone has their own convictions and that was one of mine.

Since then, I have been getting the latter part of that verse. The beginning is not even an issue. I don't even have a taste for alcohol anymore! So I bypass that and immediately jump to the "<em>be filled with the Spirit</em>" part. #WontHedoit God will take what you was trying to hold on to and show you that He is SO much more! Hallelujah!!

I often times get the comment, "I don't know/I don't see how you do it girl. No sex! Till marriage!!? I cant" and my response to that is, "Only Jesus". TRUST ME!! This was NOT the plan!!! But God is so good and He is GREAT at keeping you, only if you want to be kept. I've compromised my purity along my walk. I placed myself in situations where it coulda went down, heck; how far it was, it SHOULDA went down, oh but God! Even while shaking His head, I'm sure, He still had the Holy Spirit telling me, "No. Don't do it, I have so much more better in store for you." and I thank God for ears to hear Him and a heart to follow Him, cuz I didn't do it. As much as my body wanted to, my Spirit just would not let me go there. Praise God! There's a verse that says<em> how no temptation is common to man, but God gives you a way to escape it</em> (1 Cor 10:13). Let me tell you:: <strong>THAT VERSE IS TRUTH!!!</strong> See, this is why it is important to read and study your Bible and to really get close to God and get to know Him and have a RELATIONSHIP with Him. He is here to help you! Not to harm you. He's here to help you start living and not stop your life. He came so that <em>you can have life and have it <strong>MORE</strong> abundantly</em>! (John 10:10). The devil is the one that's out to destroy and kill you! But I digress, back to my testimony...

So yes, God is a keeper. He is able to keep you in the midst of your hard times, trials, struggles, and singleness. He just gave me the revelation that I may not be a virgin after my natural birth, but I am virgin since my Spiritual birth; so dwell on that, and I am grateful to Him for that! Since giving up sex, I've gained self worth. Since giving up sex and receiving Christ, I can finally see. I see who was here for me and who was not. Who was in it to hit it and who was not in it for the long haul and I am happy bout that! Before I even gave my life to Christ, I made the decision to give it up for a while because I got tired of having meaningless sex. I got tired of being the side piece with a biscuit. I got tired of people not taking me serious. I got tired of feeling "obligated" to have sex. I just plain ole got tired. PERIOD! That stuff gets old man, I don't see how people can keep going like that, but again, I digress. So yeah, I had NO plans of really giving it up for an extended period of time, but when I said that I was waiting for a "meaningful relationship" to give it up again, I guess God was like, "Yep! You sure am, and what's more meaningful that a man asking you to marry him!?" Hey. Sister girl couldn't argue with that!! Boop!

Maannn!! This is the deep one!! Soulties. Strongholds. Bondage. My God!!! God is a HEALER!!!! He can mend the broken pieces. He can stop the Woman at the Well from quenching her natural thirst and start quenching her Spiritual thirst. (I hope you caught that!) Y'all, when I tell you, going on 2 years of being saved, some things really take time to be healed from and get over. Your salvation happens in that moment of accepting Christ, but that's just where your deliverance begins. Cleary, wrote about him a few times, I was in deep bondage with this guy. I'm talking a hold I can't even tell you he had on me because I don't even know what it was. But God! God gave me the opportunity to reach out to him to thank him for all the hurt he caused me because it was to my good (remember, what they (the devil) <em>intended for your harm God will make it to your good</em>--GET THIS--<em>as it is TODAY, to save MUCH people ALIVE!! </em>Gen 50:20). I'm trying to help save you!! Bruh, if the Word don't excite you, man! I am convinced you are DEAD!!! Tuh! Anywho! So yeah, I talked to him and it was a good talk, good cry all that....but how many of you know, it came around again!? Look, as long as you are under God's covering, He is obligated to help you; but when YOU step out of it, He is not. Well, remember I said earlier how He gives you a way out??? Well, he did that with this guy and showed me that's not the way to go and now, I can OFFICIALLY say that God has healed me from that and I am as FREE as a bird. He can do it!!!

NOW! On to the even MORE exciting part!!!! Once upon a time, I thought that love was not for me. (Not much detail...check out my book when it comes out), but God! Ladies, when you submit yourself to God and STOP focusing and SEARCHING for a mate, you allow God to do what He wants to do for you and in you. You allow God to be Him and bless His children. Remember that "<em>HE who FINDS a WIFE finds what is good and receives favor from the Lord"</em> Proverbs 18:22, NIV **emphasis added**). So chill bruh; the Lord knows what He is doing. He is MORE than capable to bring you a spouse in the midst of a "man drought". **Raises hand** Ise a witness! <em>"Take delight in the Lord, and He will give you the desires of your heart" (</em>Psalm 37:4). God knows more about you than you know about yourself. He not only knows your wants, because that's what you voice Him, but He knows your NEEDS which are MUCH more important!! <strong>MUCH!!!</strong>

If God can deliver, keep, heal, and bless me; I know for a FACT that He can do the same for you. This life may sometimes come as a challenge, but it is worth it. No matter how big you may THINK your sacrifice is of whatever, remember that it will NEVER amount to the sacrifice Christ did on Calvary. He gave His life for you and for me. Not that we will automatically be saved, but that we MIGHT BE SAVED!!! He sacrificed His life KNOWING that there will still be us who doubt Him, who curse Him, who persecute Him, who will not believe in and accept Him. STILL SACRIFICED. No gift, no Jordans, no red bottoms, no nothing could ever compare to the GREATEST GIFT OF THEM ALL:: Jesus Christ.

So in the Sprit of Christmas, I challenge you to not only keep the "CHRIST" in CHRISTmas, but to give Christ a go. Repent of your sins, confess with your mouth and believe in your heart that He is Lord and be saved. Remember, that you are not alone. There are other <em>"family of believers throughout the world undergoing the same kind of sufferings"</em> (1 Pet 5:9). I'm always open for/to give an encouraging word and prayer, in Jesus name.

Have Hope
Keep the Faith
and Give Love

-DanikaKayelle XOXO

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Soooooo, be careful what you pray for. I prayed for the Lord to use me and for me to be obedient WITHOUT hesitation in the 2015, and here I am blogging at 2 something in the morning!!! Good stuff!!! Aaaaaaahhhhh!!! Anywho!! Happy New Year!!!! **Blows party horn**

So yeah, they say, "Every kiss begins with Kay", well I have been excluding that letter from my alphabet. There's this meme (of course) that says something about "If she hadn't kissed you by the 3rd date, then she's only there for the food" and it made me chuckle, but then it made me think and respond, "or maybe she's waiting until she's married".
<blockquote>***Now for my disclaimer! I have read before about Born-again Christian women waiting until their wedding date to kiss their spouse and my immediate thought was, "ARE THEY CRAZY?!?!?!" But as time went on, I became crazy myself!!***</blockquote>
I struggled with the decision for some time because me like to kiss and you see, <strong>that was my problem! </strong>So when I actually DID start dating, it just came out before I knew it, that I wanted to wait and it is so.

As I look back on my kissing journey, I realized that with one simple kiss, things immediately (in my head and my body) escalated. Once the flesh comes alive, its hard to control it and I recognized that I had a problem, so I'm good on my decision! (It's what works for you!)

It takes a strong man and a TRUE Christian man to not only wait for sex until they are married, BUT to accept the fact that you don't even want to kiss until then and be cool with that!!! <strong>WHAT?!?!?! </strong>(I thank God for my man!) So ladies! YES! Whatever your desires are, if they line up with the Will of God, HE WILL FULFILL THEM! "<em>Delight thyself in the Lord; and He shall GIVE thee the desires of thine heart, Commit thy way unto the Lord; TRUST also in Him; and He shall BRING IT TO PASS"</em> Psalm 37:4-5, KJV (<em>Emphasis added). </em>Hallelujah!!
<p style="text-align: center;">So now, here are my reasons for waiting::</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">1. I trust God MORE than myself, cuz I am no good!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">2. I respect the man that I am dating.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">3. I know I have a problem; I know my limits and my boundaries.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">4. Once the flesh is alive, it is hard to control it. That is why you DIE to flesh.....KILL IT!!!!!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">5. I do not want to be misleading, a tempter, or a hindrance.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">6. MY FLESH IS NO GOOD!!!!</p>
Romans 7 and verse 18 tells us that in our flesh <em>"dwelleth NO GOOD THING"</em>!!! So you see why I said that twice. God placed that desire, not to kiss until my wedding day, in my heart because He knows me and had I hit the ball and moved to first base, we would have ran to second, possibly slid to third, and would have may been trying to sneak to home base! Tuh! Can't have that happening. <del>NOPE!!</del> So yeah. I also respect him with his purity journey to not put him in any compromising situation. I want it to be easy for him without adding any other unnecessary challenges along the way. <em>"Be careful, however, that the exercise of your rights does not become a stumbling block to the weak...When you sin against them in this way and wound their weak conscience, you SIN AGAINST CHRIST"! (</em>1 Cor 8: 9 and 11, NIV) Garsh! Even though it may not be a struggle for him to control himself, I know that it is for me and I can be a bit persistent at times: "<em>So then, every one of us shall give account of himself to God. Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that NO MAN put a stumbling block OR an occasion to fall in his [0r her] brother's way" </em>Romans 14:12-13, KJV, now lets move on. So you see, recognizing you have a problem and knowing your limits and boundaries are a MUST! You don't want to put yourself in any compromising situations as well as them. TRUST ME! You will have enough of other things to work on and worry about! Chill out; you wont miss it! We all can attest to how liberating doing things you want to do, in that moment, is; but as born again believers, we know that the flesh is no good (Rom 7:18) and that we are no longer debtors to the flesh and therefore no longer live after the flesh, but after the Spirit (Romans 8:12-13). So do what you got to do to kill that lustful flesh of yours!!! (except get a tattoo, cuz my accountability peeps wont let me! Blah...) I also don't want to be misleading by saying one thing and doing another:: Remember, actions speak louder than words! Not tryna be a seductive temptress like the Proverbs 7 woman (READ IT!) as well as a hindrance like we mentioned earlier about the stumbling block. And of course again, this flesh I'm living in is ratchet!!

People laugh and joke and question how do I know and how will I know "what's up" if I'm not indulging in those types of activities and my thing to that is this: Jesus knows what I like and I TRUST and believe that He will not play me when it comes to that!! But I don't need those attributes to know about him. He has all the other MAJOR qualities and characteristics to let me know what the deal is. So ladies, don't let any one plant bad seeds in you and water them. REMEMBER::
<blockquote>"<em>Love is PATIENT, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is NOT SELF-SEEKING, it is not easily angered, it keeps NO records of wrongS </em>(I just had to emphasize that right there, don't mind me), <em>Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It ALWAYS PROTECTS, always trust, always hopes, ALWAYS PRESERVES. </em>[and most of all] <em>Love. Never. Fails." </em>1 Corinthians 13:4-8 **emphasis added**</blockquote>
So bae, if your boo thang ain't presenting those qualities from that verse, and he (or she fellas) keep tryna convince you to change your mind and MAKE you feel like you got to compromise....LET THAT GO shawty. They ain't for you and they sure as heck ain't for God. Now go run and tell that!!!

Toodles!!!!!

WOW, so of course when I read it today it was filled with much revelation and conviction. Girl, that flesh ain't no JOKE!! I'm really sitting here saying Lord I am filthy with Casey J "fill me up" on repeat because I am a true mess. If it was up to my flesh I would surely be dead, but MY GOD!!! Thank you. His new mercies and second chances times a gazillion is the bomb.com! Day 7 of 2015 and I'm already slipping. But I'm super grateful for the Holy Spirit, God, Jesus, and thankful that he sent me you! 
Your writing has truly blossomed and you are exercising your God given gifts. I'm super proud of you and who you are becoming.  Often times we need to be reminded to stay in the race and through you God has sent me that reminder. Thank you for being obedient to God's voice and getting up at 2am to write this. You have an amazing gift continue to nurture, water, and groom it. The best is yet to come!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Oh my gosh!!!! It finally hit me!!! Understanding. I finally understand understanding!!! What it means, why you need it, how to get it. I was messing around this morning in the spirit and thought of that Xscape song "Understanding" and it dawned on me. Them girls kind of knew what they were talking about!!!! The chorus says: "What I need from you is understanding, how can we communicate if you don't hear what I say. What I need from you is understanding, so simple as 1-2-3, understanding is what we need." However, it is NOT so simple as 1-2-3. Ugh! The Bible says in Proverbs 4:7 and 8, <em>"The beginning of wisdom is this: Get wisdom. Though it cost <strong>ALL YOU HAVE</strong>, get understanding. Cherish her, and she will exalt you; embrace her, and she will honor you." {Emphasis added} </em>

Understanding <strong>WILL</strong> cost you! It will cost you to put YOU aside, it will cost you to not rely on your own thinking, but that of others, it will cost you to humble yourself, it will cost you to do away with your pride, it will cost you to apologize, it will cost you see things differently, understanding will cost you to suck it up and realize that you my sweet, handsome, beautiful, and awesome friend is ...and understand this... NOT<del> ALWAYS RIGHT</del> nor do you <del>KNOW EVERYTHING</del>!!!! Naahmeen!? We are to go to God and ask for this: wisdom and understanding; "<em>For the Lord gives wisdom; from His mouth come knowledge and understanding" </em>Proverbs 2:6, NIV and "<em>If any of you lacks wisdom, you should <strong>ASK</strong> God, who gives <strong>GENEROUSLY</strong> to <strong>ALL</strong> without finding fault, and it will be</em> {get this}<em> <strong>GIVEN to you</strong>."</em> James 1:5, NIV {Emphasis added} God knows all; He's omniscient, remember (Hebrews 4:13--if you wanted a reference) so it only makes sense to go to the source when you need to know something. I mean, that's what you do in "real life" anyways right??? If you don't know how to put together something, what do you do?? You go to the instructions, read what they say, and the finished product, if assembled correctly, shows that you understood what you read. Am I right, or am I right??? Well, this is the same with life situations; with people. In order to understand them or something, you must ask and seek information.

Understanding is not just a one way street and its not just about the other person. It's about you too! You have to be active in order to understand, and not only that; you have to WANT to understand. Some things you may not understand right away and that's okay, but when you DO understand it; understand it. Nothing worse than doing the opposite of what's understood. What do I mean? Let's take a side street:: How much drama, hurt, tears, time, energy, money, heartaches, etc. you could have saved if only you really understood what "we just chilling" is??? Or "I ain't really looking for nothing right now, just wanna have fun and maybe we can see where this can go.." Blah blah, bull horn!! I will answer for you...A LOT!!! I wish I really understood things that were clearly said to me back then. Not that I didn't hear them, I just didn't want to believe them, so I never tried to understand them. But now, totally new ball game!!

**Back on the main road** We will never understand God. No sense in even trying...(read Isaiah chapter 55), but with Him and through Him, we can understand things around us. Like now, I understand that not everyone will get or understand me and that's okay; that is actually meant to be. Why? Because not everyone is designed to be or go with me and every time I go higher into Christ and get deeper in Him, things has to be left behind otherwise it will burden me and I wont be able to receive from Him and/or be filled with Him and she is not trying to have thaaaaat; no sir, no ma'am! We, as a body of believers, must know, believe, <strong>AND UNDERSTAND</strong> that we have a mission! We have a task! We have a goal! <em><strong>WE HAVE A PURPOSE</strong></em>!!! This life we are living is not our own (1 Cor 6:19-20). I believe once we understand that, we will begin to see. See what? See things...see prayers...see people for who and what they truly are. We will know our roles and we will understand which one to take on. We will understand to not entertain certain things because there are bigger things to handle. Its never about you. Understand that! You wasn't even saved for you! Ha! (2 Timothy 1:9) You were saved for Him so that other people can see Him MANIFESTED in YOUR life and you can reach out to others and tell them about the goodness of Jesus so that they TOO may be saved and partake in all of His glory! Hallelujah!!! I'm excited that I will never understand God, WHY?! Because I just LOVE getting new revelations about the Guy. He is super, totally amazing!!!

This blog seem to have taken a different approach than how I imagined it, but I understand that this is how it was supposed to be. My prayer is that we begin to understand things. Not just hear them, not just read them; but understand them. I read in one of the books I am reading currently, "Perfectly Unique" by Annie Downs, that "you can hear everything, but you <em>choose to listen</em>...Hearing is to receive information by the ear and listening is to give attention with the ear". Do you see the difference?? Now, do you UNDERSTAND the difference!? Understand that yes, "<em>if you confess with your mouth and believe in your heart that Jesus is Lord and He was raised from the dead, you will be saved" </em>(Romans 10:9), but at the same token, understand that "<em>Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and in your name perform many miracles?' Then I will tell them PLAINLY, 'I never knew you. Away from me, you evil does!'" </em>(Matthew 7:22-23) WOW!! I don't know bout you, but I understood that verse clearly and know for a facto that I do NOT want to hear those words come from Jesus' mouth, PLAINLY as He put it...! So I understand that just confessing Him with my mouth and believing Him in my heart is just not enough...I must do the works..

So all in all, understanding is an act we must all work on. We must seek and ask the Lord for it and "<em>cherish her and embrace her</em>". We need understanding to have successful relationships and fellowship, otherwise it would be just a bunch of circles and mumbo jumbo! So talk, share and not only that; but hear and listen as well so that you, we, me, I (I'm talking to me too) may understand and we must also acknowledge what we understand by doing it.
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>You cannot move forward unless you understand your now and what to do next.
Remember that.</em></p>
</blockquote>
||The opposite of understand is miss. So if you didn't understand this, you missed it||

Bless and Be blessed...

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This morning I had the pleasure of watching the sunrise in the mountains and I was immediately amazed. I started praising and thanking God for this opportunity and just started fellowshipping with Him. Then as you can see, this blog is happening. As I watched the sunrise; conversion from sin was brought to my mind. Just as beautiful as the sunrise was, that's how beautiful conversion from sin is! Out here in the mountains before the sun came up, it was pitch black; I mean you couldn't see ANYTHING! That's how living in sin, in darkness is.
<blockquote><em>You can't see anything. You can't see the mess you're in until God shines the light and then you can see the beautiful [mess]age you are! </em></blockquote>
Then as I sat there watching the sun creep up into the sky God said, "That's how the conversion happens in your life. You get a little bit at a time and then bam!" When you get saved, you begin to see things differently and slowly the change begins to be recognizable and then bam! I can see clearly now, the sin is gone...I'm alive, alive, alive in Christ!

As I sat up and watched the sunrise, I had the book of Psalm playing in my ear and I got to Psalm 104 and verse 20 says:: "Thou makest darkness and it is night: wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth." And I remembered how dark it is out here at night and it was scary!!! Darkness, for humans, is scary. That's because we were and are not designed to operate in darkness, but in light. The light of Christ! Doesn't the song say "the freaks come out at night?" Do you know what is freak is??? And no, not somebody who be doing something strange for a piece of change (or for free, cuz they got them out here too). Freedictionary.com defines freak as a thing of occurrence that is markedly unusual or irregular, an abnormally formed organism, especially one regarded as a curiosity, a sudden capricious turn of mind; a whim; a drug user or addict, an eccentric or nonconformist person, especially a member of a counterculture, an enthusiast, and something or someone highly unusual or irregular. God didn't make you to be a freak but he made you wonderfully and fearfully!!!! (Psalm 139:14)

Here's the thing that gets me. In your darkest skies you have the brightest starts. Why!? Because God is trying to give you a sign. He's tryna show you that you don't have to live in darkness. Let alone, complete darkness! Ha! Hallelujah! God is SO good!!!! The stars are saying, "see, there is light in this world". If you follow the North Star which is the brightest star, it will bring you home, however; where is the North Star located!?!?  In the sky! God is trying to say, follow me...I am home! Oh em gee!!! This Dude never cease to amaze me. He's constantly revealing. CONSTANTLY! You either have sunset or sunrise. You will never see it any other way because darkness and light CANNOT<del> fellowship together</del> (2 Cor 6:14). You won't see the sun shining at night, oh, but just like the stars, there is the moon. However, it's still dark. Why!? <strong>Because we need the SON!!!</strong> We need Jesus to see the light!! Because Jesus IS the Light!
<blockquote>1 John 1:5:<em> "This is the message we have heard form him and declare to you: God is light; in Him there is no darkness at all." </em></blockquote>
I believe there is beauty in ANY sunrise you see; whether it is out here in the mountains, at the beach, or outside your window or home wherever you live because there is beauty in conversion from sin and that can take place ANYwhere you may be! God is not limited to a church building. You can accept Him and begin to live for Him in your house, at the strip club, the crack alley, or someone else's bed as it was for me. However; you MUST find you a Bible based church home to fellowship and grow because you WILL need to be fed. Not that you can't do it on your own, but that is the way God made it to be. Afterall, He knows what He is doing.
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>I was glad when they said unto me, "Let us go into the house of the Lord."</em>
(Psalm 122)</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">However, we must not forget that it is <del>not</del> about the church as a building, but the church as a people.</p>
</blockquote>
So I challenge you to wake up a little bit early, before the sun rises, and read Psalm 104 before you watch the sunrise and just take it all in. God did that! Isn't that amazing!?!?!! But not only that, remember that::
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">The SON ROSE for you and for me!
1 Corinthians 15:3-4</p>
</blockquote>
Praise Jesus!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I need a word, and I know for a fact that when I write, I get just that! So here I am. I am confused, but God is not the author of confusion (1 Cor 14:33) so in order for me to be confused, I must be outside of His will and leaning unto my own understanding and not trusting Him and acknowledging Him in ALL my ways (Prov 3:5-6). So now, what do I do?? Well, I must stand still and know that He is God (Ps 46:10).

God is not moved by our emotions, He does not work nor does He operate on our time. His ways are not our ways, His thoughts are not our thoughts (Is 55:8). God doesn't care if we feel like its time for Him to answer, reveal, deliver and no, it's not because He is a mean and evil God, but because He is God that is omniscient and knows all (1 John 3:20). Look at the story of Job. Job could have easily said, "Okay God, now come on. You done took all of my belongings, and then you take my kids. I mean really, don't you think its time you go on ahead and give me back me??" But he didn't. Each time I uncover the story of Job, I get more and more amazed and inspired.

So in my confusion, in the dilemmas that I face; I'm battling: How deep is my faith, how much do I trust God, when do and when will I know when enough is enough and I've done all that I can do and tried as hard as I can try?! And as I search for the answer, I'm reminded of Job, I'm reminded of the children of Israel, I'm reminded of Moses, of Abraham, of Joseph, of Jonah, of Jesus, of Ruth and honestly, of myself. What I know is that God won’t give us more that we can bare. What I know is there is a blessing in every storm. What I know is my trials are my test. What I know is the fights are not with flesh and blood but spiritual (Eph 6:12). What I know is in everything there is a lesson to learn. So as I seek for the answer, I know the answer. Now is not the time to give up, now is not the time to throw in the towel. There is ALWAYS sunshine after the storm and living in New Orleans, I KNOW everyday is not that perfect spring Sunday. So as I sit here writing this blog to speak life into my own life, I want to do the same for your life.

Whatever confusion and/or dilemmas you are facing; if you are struggling with trying to figure out if you've done all that you can do and you feel like there could be more...do the more. When Jesus hung on that cross for us, bruised and beaten, He didn't give up the Ghost until there was nothing else for Him to do. He done all that He could do. He lived His life until there was no more life that He had to live in the flesh. We as Christians are to be Christ-like, so do what you need to do until there is no more before you go and give up and start throwing in the towel, because at the end of the day; in Christ we know that we are MORE than conquerors (Rom 8:37), above and not beneath, the head and not the tail, the lender and not the borrower (Deut 8:12-13) and as we think and reflect on the story of Job we know that our latter is blessed more than our former (Job 42:12).

Just this past Sunday, Pastor Hall spoke on the topic: "I am coming out of this" and he posed a question that I need to sit and ponder on that maybe you feeling the way I do should do the same. He asked: "Can you go through the pressure to get the blessing and are you willing to be a part of God's plan?"
<blockquote> [Note::] You WILL have to go &gt;through&lt; something to get &gt;to&lt; something, but the choice is yours of how far you are willing to go.</blockquote>
I wanna go as far as I can, until I can't go anymore. If I can do all things through Christ Jesus who strengthens me (Phil 4:13) and I rely on Him to be my refuge and my strength (Ps 62: 5-8), then there should be no giving up or giving in UNLESS it's in the will of God because as long as I am Child of God, which will be until I die; I will ALWAY be on top. And now as I come to a close, I feel relieved, I'm smiling and I'm laughing because I got the revelation, confirmation, and clarification I needed and was seeking. This is the year of supernatural manifestation. This is the year where I will see the things I am praying for; so of course Satan is coming with it because He doesn't want God to win.... But guess what!? We already got the victory!! Hallelujah!! (Oh, that's gonna piss him off! Ha! Who cares!!?!)
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">"<em>Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sister, whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance. Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything."</em>
James 1:2-4, NIV</p>
</blockquote>
She is not in the lack.

Bless and Be blessed.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Scrolling through Instagram I see your nornal post and never knew you had a blog site. This blog has inspired me to keep moving and push forward. I realized that everyone journey is different and in order to find true happiness one must find it within themselves first. What Is my happiness ?? That's the question I been asking myself. How can someone seem like they have it together and then feel like a lump of coal in the insides I believe true happiness comes from know that God is always giving you yhay peice of Heaven in the midst of every storm . He is my comfort and he has given me happiness.

Thank you and keep sharing]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Hiiiiii!!!! So there are times where we just need to relax and unwind and things and I came across that time so I went on a "Jesus and me" date! (Which are totally awesome by the way!) I went to see the movie “Do You Believe?” and it was centered around this one basic question:: “Do you believe in the cross of Christ?” Those 8 words carry so much weight!! It’s probably just as heavy as the cross Jesus was carrying. You see, the cross is so vital! Without the cross, salvation may not have happened. Jesus <strong>had to die</strong> the worst possible death EVER because we were (and some of us still are) the worse possible people ever!! But the cross symbolizes our <strong>sin</strong> and our sins are the <del>WORST</del>! So Jesus had to become <em><strong>one with sin</strong></em> (hence, the nails in His hands and feet) and <em><strong>bleed</strong></em> on it (so that we may be washed by the blood) and <strong><em>freed from sin </em></strong>(hence His Resurrection)!! [I pray and hope you caught the visualization of Jesus' death and our salvation through that just now]

Now I wasn't surprised, but in the course of the movie, there were a lot of distractions for me. I went there with a heavy mind, then they had this family with I don’t know how many kids moving around and I was very distracted, but I still was able to get a message and that how God will do it::
<blockquote><em>In the midst of everything that is going on, God will still take time out and speak to you and reveal things to you.</em></blockquote>
He is so amazing!! Now the question is asked, "Do you believe?", and you can simply say “Yes”, but what does your “yes” mean? Is it a strict and stern “yes” no questions asked or is there some hesitation behind your “yes” and let me tell you, while watching that movie, I walked out with some hesitations.

Now I know you’re probably thinking, “But Danika, it was just a movie” and that is where you are wrong. We can’t take things so lightly. That movie was a message! It was made to wake us Christians up and get us thinking. In the movie, and I hope you seen it cuz I am about to spoil the heck out of it; well not really, but people was literally risking their lives and livelihood for the sake of Christ and I was like, “Man! Do I do that!?” Sadly for me, I don’t know if I can completely say yes to that question. **Help me Lord** Each day is a challenge and each day we are faced with something new. There will be times when we undoubtedly can agree with God and completely give Him the “go ahead” [like we really have ‘sition to do so] and then there will be times when we question Him like “are you sure you really want me to do this?!” and that all boils back down to the title of this movie: “DO YOU BELIEVE?”

If you believe, it shouldn’t matter who understands you/it or not. If you believe, it shouldn’t matter if it makes sense to you or not. If you believe, it shouldn’t matter if you live or you die. The only thing that should matter is <strong>your belief in God</strong>. It is His duty that He obligated Himself to do to take care of us and to see us through. I always have to go back and remind myself of the 55<sup>th</sup> chapter in the book of Isaiah where He says “<em>My </em><em>thoughts are not your thoughts neither your ways My ways</em>” and realize that regardless of what I think, it may not be His thinking or whichever way I feel I will go about something may not necessarily be the way He’s thinking. For instance, I can say to myself, “Self, to make it home, you’re going to take the interstate, get off, make a few turns and that’s it” whereas He may be thinking, “There is something I want to protect her from, so she cannot take the interstate home, but go the scenic route” and sure enough, me being me, I am going to try my best to take the interstate and then ima run into some heavy traffic and turn around and go the scenic route to find out there was something that happened that I could have and would have been in the midst of had I stayed on the interstate. And see, some people would see that as maybe a coincidence, but as a believer, I don’t believe in coincidences but I believe in Godcidence. (No such word, but still catch it!) A friend once told me, and it stuck with me as you can see, you cannot have <strong>faith</strong> if you believe in <del>fate</del>. Yes, there is destiny and a destination for your life, but ultimately you do make the decision on where you are going to reside in the afterlife. God does not sit in Heaven and point out each individual at the time of conception saying, “This one Heaven, this one Hell...”,
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>He gives us a free will to choose whom we will serve.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
When you give your life to Christ, in order to be saved, you have to “confess with your mouth and BELIEVE in your heart that Jesus is Lord and that He died for our sins and rose again on the third day”. You can’t just say, “Yeah, He did that” **Tamar voice**, you have to believe as well and you have to believe it IN your heart because that is where life lives, that is where love lives. You are <del>dead without a heart</del> just like you are <del>dead without Christ</del> and that is why He stands at the door of your heart knocking, asking you to let Him in and reside there.
<p style="text-align: center;">Faith without actions is <strong><del>dead</del></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Confession without belief, you are <del><strong>not saved</strong></del>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Jesus without the cross is <strong><del>no redemption</del></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Death with no resurrection is<strong><del> no salvation</del></strong>.</p>
Like my Pastor always say: “Only those who believe will receive cuz only the believer receives” and that is so true. If you believe "<em>God is able to make all grace abound towards you</em>" (1Cor 9:8) then you will receive that grace, but if you don't....then well uh....you wont! Pretty simple eh?! So now back to the question that this blog is centered around and I pray you are giving your answer some thought before you open your mouth:
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Do you…….believe???</strong></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Right now, in this moment, as I sit at my desk eating this dry and baconless McAlister's club sandwich (blah) and BBQ Lays and reflecting; one of the lights in the chandelier started flickering and immediately I was like, "Alright Lord, what You got for me?" Well, what He had is this blog!

I literally sat here and watch the light flicker on and off for a good minute, looking like it was in a real struggle, then eventually burn out and I thought about the body of Christ. In Matthew 5:14, Jesus tells us that we are the light of the world, but just like that light, sometimes its a struggle to keep it shinning and sadly, burnouts sometimes happens. Look, I'll be honest! There are many a days (well not many, but quite a few!) I don't wanna do anything and when the going get tough and the struggle gets real, I wanna do just like that light and go out! I mean really, I wanna go to sleep! Lol..but that's not the way to do things, especially as a believer because they are people lives depending on us. Matthew 5:16 says, "<em>Let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in Heaven.</em>" We must continue to let our light shine and fight the good fight of faith (1 Timothy 6:12) and not grow weary in good doing (Galatians 6:9) because the picture is ALWAYS bigger than what we see!
<p style="text-align: left;">As that light bulb went out, the room got a little darker, and that's what happens to the world when we let our light die. I'm sorry, but as believers our task is great! I mean, Christ did die the ultimate death (that didn't even keep Him!) so you really thought He would give us little to nothing to do?! Pshh..please! We Christians are "<em>a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God's <strong>SPECIAL</strong> possession</em>"; we were called "<em>out of darkness into His wonderful light</em>!" (1 Peter 2:9, emphasis added). I think that the battle was so hard with that light bulb because it really didn't want to go out and personally speaking, I know that's how the war between flesh and spirit is with believers. It's a struggle because we really don't want to give in, but sometimes the struggle seems so hard to where it feels/looks easier to just give in. But its not. With this light going out, someone is going to have to grab another bulb, get a ladder, climb up, unscrew the old bulb, screw in the new bulb, climb down, put away the ladder, and then discard the dead light bulb. Do you see the work that it takes to get the light shinning again!?</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;My friend, it is not easier going out, what's best is staying in. When you step outside of the will of God, it is harder trying to get back in. It requires a lot of work and not necessarily from God, but from you! Keep shining.&lt;&lt;&lt;</em></p>
</blockquote>
Looking at the chandelier, it looks like something is missing. It dark, gloomy, and frankly, not pretty. When all the lights are on, the chandelier is beautiful! It's vibrant and bright and warms up the room. Do you see where I'm getting at?! When your light is dim or gone, you are not yourself. You no longer stand out, but fit in. If its dark, no one can tell that you are different. No one can tell that you are chosen, you are royal, you are special. You are going to look just like the next Joe Black or Jane Red as the next one. But when you are lit and you are shining, people can see the difference, they can see there's something in the inside, they can see that you stand out and set apart and then God gets the glory as it should be.
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">{<em>Light attracts while darkness attacks</em>}</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">Oh my gosh!! Wrapping up this blog, the light came back on shinier than ever!! Look at God!!! And believe you me, I am NOT making this up! I love the way God moves and reveals things. He is always speaking, we are normally the ones not listening. This is only a refresher blog, a reminder to not let your light go out but to fight that lil fight you got going on and come out shinier than ever and give God the praise!!! He will not bring you to it if He has no means of getting you through it. God starts at the end.. My Pastor always say "God speaks the ending at the beginning"...(Never really got that until the Holy Spirit reveled that to me.) I love Isaiah chapter 55 and the reason why I love it is because it helps me to keep holding on to God's promises because in this chapter it tells how His word, once it comes out of His mouth, "<em>shall NOT return unto Him void, but SHALL accomplish what He desire and achieve the purpose for which He sent it"</em> (V11) *emphasis added**. So this means, when God says something, it is going to happen! And since it's going to happen, it doesn't matter where the starting point is.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now my people, fight that darkness that's trying to creep in and take over. Stay the course. Know that darkness <strong><del>cannot</del> </strong>and <strong><del>will not win</del> </strong>and continue to let your light shine!!!</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">"<em>The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it."</em>
John 1:5</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[...Its been a long time, I shouldn't of left you without a dope blog to read...

But really, it has been a while. Pray all has been well... It has been for me, well, for the most part!

So yeah, I went to get a massage on  yesterday. Well needed and amazing might I add and I prayed before I went in for the Holy Spirit to commune with me and He did; hence I'm here!!! As I was getting my massage, the masseuse had complete control over my body. She was moving my arm, pushing my shoulders down, shaking and bending my wrist, flexing my feet, etc. and as she was doing that, on some parts, I was still being resistant and not fully letting her do her job which tensed my body up more and had her working even harder and the kinks a little bit more painful and the Holy Spirit spoke and said "This is what you do to me Danika. You let me do my job, but you still resist me at some points and when things  get uncomfortable" and I have to be honest, He's right (as usual). I'm sure I'm not alone in this, but we got to get out of this. We sing the song, "I surrender all" and sure; we may really mean it in our hearts, but in our actual physical life, we really and truly do not surrender it all. Then the Holy Spirit has to come in and push our shoulders down, shake our wrists, flex our feet, and move our arms until He works some of the kinks out.

God has created us to be dependent on Him in ALL areas of our lives, not just some, but all. I'm reminded of so many scriptures where God mentions "all". For instance, Proverbs 3:5, "<em>Trust in the Lord with <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ALL</strong></span> your heart and lean not to your own understanding</em>", Romans 8:28, "<em>And we know that in <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ALL</strong></span> things God works for the good of those who love Him, who have been called according to His purpose</em>", Matthew 11:28, "<em>Come to me, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ALL</strong></span> you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest</em>", 1 Peter 5:7, "<em>Give <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ALL</strong></span> your worries and cares to God, for He cares about you</em>" {Emphasis added}; I can keep going on, but I hope you get my drift. God does not say "one or two", "a couple, some, or a few", but He says "ALL"! All meaning the ones that makes us comfortable and uncomfortable, the ones we are not sure about and the ones we are sure about, the ones that we don't really wanna do along with those that we really want to do, the ones where we have to step up and be the bigger person as well as the ones we must back down, humble ourselves and admit our wrong doings and repent; all! There's no picking and choosing here my dear...All or nothing!

My First Lady always talk about "keeping it in the light". What is "it" you ask? Well, "it" can be anything!! For me, right now, my "it" is my control issues. In order to receive help, you must first admit there is a problem...bringing "it" to "the light", get it!? Who/Where is the light?? Read John 8:12 for the answer. You see, in order for God to help with something, you must first present Him with the problem. He may already know it, but He is not an intruder; He's polite and a Gentleman! :) Prior to my massage, I have been realizing that my control issues are becoming a bit of a problem. Nothing too major, but it has the potential to get there if I don't get it under control or at least learn when and how to turn it on and off. So I started to pray towards that area and ask God to reveal and help me in this area ergo the conversation we had while I was on the massage table. And that's another thing (off topic), but we sometimes try to look for this big sign and big shebang when God uses all sorts of avenues to speak to us and then we miss it and point the finger and blame God saying "He's not answering/speaking"...uh, no boo, you're not listening!! Ugh.. Example.. For me, it was this massage, but it could have been a song, a scripture, a friend, my Pastor, a billboard, a movie, a light fixture, a child, a nonbeliever, rain, a tree, park, etc. We gotta get out of this whole mentality that God only uses certain avenues to speak to and with us. God created EVERYTHING, therefore He can use ANYTHING!! Geeze.. Okay, rant over!

Now as I conclude this blog, I'll bring it back to the massage. In order to truly enjoy and reap the FULL benefits of a massage, you have to be completely relaxed. You have to lie there in all stillness with a clear head, taking deep breaths, not allowing your body tense up, and allow the masseuse to do their thing and afterwards, you get up feeling all refreshed, loosened, and rejuvenated. That is the same thing with God. God is our Masseuse. As a matter of fact, we are clay and God is the Potter (don't believe me? Read Isaiah 64:8 and Jeremiah chapter 18). God wants to do a work in and with us and He wants us to give Him full control to do so! If you are a control freak like me, you are already in your head thinking "how can I do that?" and the answer is simple: Get a massage! Lie there in all stillness (Psalm 46:10), clear your head (Isaiah 55:8-9), take deep breaths (Isaiah 42:5-7), and not allow your body to tense up (Psalm 37:3-7) and let the Spirit do His job!!!

This is a challenge for myself, but I already know that I have the victory and conquered this! I am here to not only say this for me, but for you too!! Whatever "it" is, you got this!! But you must first be in the Will of God. He calls for "all", but not "all" comes. Therefore, not everyone will come out on top; but if you are a believer, and you believe in your heart and confess with your mouth that Jesus died and rose again for your sake, you are saved and can now (not later, but NOW) reap the benefits of the Kingdom and tackle every stronghold, trial, temptation, tasks, tribulation, that may come your way with the help of Jesus who strengthens you!! Easy right!??! (No worries, that's all Bible there!)

I'm praying for you and do not be/get discouraged my friend. You are not alone...God is with you, He loves you, and wants you to succeed and prosper!!!

Bless and Be Blessed!

PS... After the massage is over, the masseuse tells you to stay hydrated, so I must do the same! Make sure you are drinking from the Living Well and stay hydrated in Christ!!!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As I was showering, I was reflecting on a word that I heard today to where my mind took off and recollected of other things. I thought about my life, stories I've read, stories I've heard, parables and stories in the Bible. While thinking on all these things, I thought about the game Monopoly. Everyone who knows the game Monopoly knoooows that the best things to have are all 4 Railroads, both Boardwalk and Park Place (with houses or hotels), and the "Get out of Jail FREE" card! Man! You got that card, you're merely winning. You keep that card close by you, ready to use it when you land in jail; or you just may sell it to the highest bidder cuz it is a hot commodity!
<p style="text-align: center;">Well, what if I told you life is like Monopoly?</p>
You roll the dice and take the called steps to find yourself either excelling, pulling a card with further directions, landing on someone else's property and owing them, paying bills, standing still (not passing go and collecting your 2), or the ultimate worse:: GOING TO JAIL! Lucky for believers and non believers alike, when you hit that rock bottom and find yourself behind bars in your situation, you don't have to wait until your next turn to post bail, use your card, or roll a double; but you can call on the name of Jesus and be set free <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">IMMEDIATELY</span></strong>!!
<p style="text-align: center;">Girl, what you talking about?!</p>
Well, lets take the message I heard earlier that brought me to this blog. The topic was "I Want Out" and he (Pastor Ryan Perkins) spoke from Mark 10:46-52 with Bartimaeus, the blind man. He was in jail with his condition of not being able to see, but then he called out and Jesus heard him and IMMEDIATELY he gained sight! No? Not enough?? Let's take the women with the issue of blood (Luke 8:40-48). She had this bloody issue for 12 years and she had no more money in her monopoly bank from all her dice rolls and found herself in jail. She touched the hem of Jesus' garment and was IMMEDIATELY healed. 12 years of blood just ceased to exist. Still not convinced?? What about the lame man at the pool in John chapter 5, the leper, the centurion servant, the healings that took place at Peter's house in Matthew chapter 8:1-17?? All of these people were immediately healed and set free from what was imprisoning them! So why can't it happen for you!?

There's this song that goes "God wants to heal you, everywhere you hurt, everywhere you hurt; God will see you through, He'll take the pain away." &lt;Earnest Pugh:: listen to it&gt; I believe they repeat "everywhere you hurt" so you can truly get it! Jesus came "not <em>to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved</em>" (John 3:17)! He wants you to live and have life <em>more abundantly</em> (John 10:10). God doesn't want you living in Hell, going to Hell, being in jail literally and figuratively. He wants you to be free, bondage free! In Christ there is freedom and liberty (Gal 5:1/2 Cor 3:15-17). As stated before, this is for believers and unbelievers alike. He is no respect of persons (Rom 2:11), He rains on the just as well as the unjust (Matt 5:45; latter).
<p style="text-align: center;">Ultimately, what I am saying is::</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Regardless of your situation, whatever decisions you are making, whatever it is that you rolled; you can still get out of jail. The question is: <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">DO YOU WANT TO</span></span><span style="color: #ff0000;">!?</span> </strong>Cuz just like each of the persons I've mentioned earlier, they did SOMETHING to get out of their situation. Now, their situations could have been a cause of a decision they made or not, but being freed from it did not seem like an option to them. And I would say unfortunately Jesus was their last option, but it was VERY fortunate that He was!</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">**My friend, you cannot be in ANY situation Jesus cannot break you from.**</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">Regardless of how many times you've rolled that same dice, He has the card. He IS the card! He's the cycle ender, the curse breaker; He's ready. He got the key in the lock. Will you do your part and walk with Him and be free?!?!?! It is my prayer that you say "yes" and throw them chains behind you and leave them there!</p>
I'm praying like crazy!! There is NOTHING like being free, but frankly, I'm just tired of people being in bondage and all I can do it pray because it is up to you, person, to do your "something", I cannot do it for you.

Bless and Be Blessed

		<title>Stepping out on faith:: Walk or Sink???</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[What brings me here this morning is reflecting on the things that has passed. A lot has happened, but what I want to talk about is something I believe a lot of us, including me, struggle with and that is stepping out on faith.

Recently, literally just yesterday, I did just that. I have made the Godconscious decision to leave my home church of two years and join and connect with another church in hopes to fulfill my destiny and walk in my purpose. Now before we get into it, let me just say that I don't regret it, but it brought me to blog about it because it was definitely a leap of faith.

Hebrews chapter 11 is the "Faith" Chapter. In verse one, it gives us the definition of faith and then goes on to say how others did and received things through faith and by faith. You see, God tells us things and drop things in our spirits that we can't really see as of yet and that is because He already knows and if He said it, then it is already done. Why? Because He speaks the ending at the beginning (Is 46:9-10). He has already done His part, the rest is up to us. That is why in v6 of Heb 11, it says: "<em>Without faith, it is impossible to please God</em>." Without faith, which according to Heb 11:1 is "<em>the substance of things hoped for, evidence of things not seen</em>", we cannot SEE the things that God is telling us, therefore not believing that its is so, which prevents us from receiving; because only the believer receives right?! But this is not what I want to get at...I just needed to lay a foundation.

With my decision to join another church to fulfill my destiny and walk in my purpose does not mean that I couldn't do that at my home church. I could have very well done that and to be honest with you, would have been TOTALLY fine with that! Why?! Because that was my comfort zone. It was very familiar; they knew me and I knew them, but it wasn't what God wanted. I'm reminded of ALL the times God took others out of their comfort zones so that they could fulfill their destiny and walk in their purpose. Who you ask?? Like Moses, Daniel, David, Ruth, Esther, Jonah, Mary, JESUS...<strong>need I go on???</strong> God has to place you in areas where you will be challenged. That way you will see your potential. You will see that you are not all that you thought you were and that you fully need to rely on God.

Stepping out of faith is going to take some getting used to, but its exciting all at the same time! It's liberating because you KNOW deep down inside you were supposed to be doing this certain thing and God is setting it all up into place. However, here is the kicker. It is up to you if you are going to walk or sink with the step you just made. (This is the answer to my prayer right here!) In Matthew chapter 14, we are told a story about Jesus walking on water (vv22-27). Unbelievable right?? But that is not the focus point. The focus point is Peter taking a step of faith. In v28, he challenges Jesus saying, "<em>Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You on the water</em>". When Jesus tells Peter to "<em>Come</em>" in the next verse, we see how important our faith is. Peter gets out of the boat and begins to walk on the water to Jesus. Now you can't tell me that wasn't out of his comfort zone. Peter was used to being IN the boat and if just so happened he was out of the boat and in the water, I am more than sure he wasn't walking on top of it! But chiiiiile, then Peter started to let the outside circumstances bother him.
<blockquote>::You know, like your family, friends, spouse, the commute, the old way versus the new way, your feelings and thoughts, doubt and uncertainty, confusion and questioning:: No? That's just me??? Well let me share this about the "outside world"...</blockquote>
When Peter started to focus on the other things, OTHER than what God/Jesus/Holy Spirit was telling him, he got afraid and began to sink crying out for God to save him. Don't believe me...read it for yourself in v30. That is exactly what will happen to us when we take that step of faith, but focus on the other things OTHER than what God told us to do. We will begin to sink and wonder why things aren't going the way it should, why your joy and peace left, why you're snapping at people for no reason, why you can't seem to catch a break, why are temptations more tempting to indulge in, why you're feeling weak, why it seems like God isn't answering your prayers and then you're gonna cry out for God to save you and Jesus is going to stretch out His hand and catch you like He did Peter in v31, but He is also going to say and ask you: "<em>O you of little faith, why did you doubt?"</em> In other words,
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Why are you not believing what I am telling you and going where I say go and doing what I say do; WHERE IS YOUR FAITH?!? </strong></p>
</blockquote>
Not to be longwinded, I will conclude here. God knows what He is doing. Regardless if we can see it and agree with it or not. It is up to us whether or not we will walk or sink. We have to keep our eyes on Jesus so that the outside world and circumstances does not cause us to sink. If we keep our focus on Jesus and the things of God, we will continue to walk on the water.

This is my prayer for everyone, including myself, who has taken a leap of faith or thinking about taking one. Once you've made that first step out of the boat (your comfort zone) and onto the water (purpose/destiny), keep the initial faith you had when you made that decision, keeping in remembrance WHY you made it in the first place, and focus solely on God so that you will not sink! And if you do just so happen to find yourself sinking, remember He will catch you when you call out.
<p style="text-align: center;">||<strong>If you drown, that was all you sweets!</strong>||</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">-DanikaKayelle XOXO</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&gt;&gt;PS:: If you are anything like me, afraid of water, you should most definitely wanna make sure you always remain on top of it! ;)</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Posse waaaaaaaaaaannnnnn!!!!!! HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!!!!! **insert emojis here**

Okay, so let me go ahead and throw this disclaimer out there now. This NOT a "New Year's Resolution" post! I repeat, this is NOT a "New Year's Resolution" post! This is an apology post (did you read the title???). So pow, here we go!

There is a LOT of things I am sorry for in 2015. For starters, I am sorry for this dead blog site. There's really no excuse other than the truth. I have been going through some stuff and I let that "stuff" shut me up! For that, 2o15, I am sorry.
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">**Btdubs, "2015" is not the year per se, "2015" is The Spirit I kept locked up instead of letting Him flow, "2015" are the people who needed to hear a word and didn't because of me, "2015" are folks whom I didn't leave a salty taste in their mouth when I was around due to my actions and words, "2015" is my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ for allowing His death be in vain because of my disobedience, delayed obedience, and/or simply not walking not only in Him, but also <del>WITH Him</del>.**</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">2015 was not a bad year. It was challenging, convicting, humbling, exciting, rebellious, trying, tempting, fun, random, weird, interesting, amongst some other things; in other words, it was a rollercoaster! I mean, typical right?? Meh. I don't really think so. I do believe that yes, life has its ups and downs and can be somewhat a rollercoaster at times, but I do also know a lot of the "nauseous symptoms" you get from riding a rollercoaster can be strictly from us hoping straight on the ride right after we ate 5 corn dogs, a bag of popcorn, a bite of a chicken on the stick, 2 pieces of a salted pretzel, and a sip of something cool to wet our throats. In other words, WE create some of the adjectives/adverbs in our lives to make the rollercoaster more significant than it needs to be. So to the year 2015, I'm sorry. You did a great job at getting me to want to give up and even failing and falling, but you've failed to keep me down and getting me to throw in the towel. I'm sorry, but what you meant for my harm, God intended for my good! (Gen 50:20)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It's funny how its only what 12 hrs in the new day and new year and we all looking back over our lives from whence we came and it's something that we should do throughout the year, but its something and somehow different when you look at it in a NEW year. It's like, "Wow! I did all that!?", "Dang! All THIS happened?! Cetuslapidis!" With that being said, lemme go into my next apology. 2015, I am sorry for the examples I have been setting. That "2015" is to the Holy Trinity (God the Father, Son Jesus, and Holy Spirit) and the people of 2015 I set bad examples for, those who needed a word and didn't, etc. Why am I apologizing??? Cuz I have NOT set great examples quite a few times. I spazzed out on folks (going against James 1:19), I've been doing my own things instead of being led and instructed by the Lord (going against Psalm 37:23), I was hearing the Word, but not doing it (going against James 1:22), setting bad, or not even bad, but mixed examples to the youth (going against Titus 2:1-5), I was taking matters into my own hands, or at least thinking I was (going against Proverbs 3:5-6). So for all these things and more 2015, I am sorry!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This apology is something that should have been given and should not have even gone this far and deep, but it did. However, it's better late than never right?! Plus, how many of you are STILL awaiting apologies?! My thoughts exactly. In all my mess, with all my mistakes, I can truly say I have learned a lot.</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Small nugget:: you should LEARN from your mess and mistakes and DO BETTER! Not do the same mess and mistakes better, but do better to NOT be in the same mess and mistakes again!</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now back to my regular scheduled program:: In all my mess and with all my mistakes, I can truly say I have learned a lot! Chile, my mirror has been some dirty and in 2015, I had to do some cleaning! Heck, I'm just a day in 2016 and I am STILL cleaning some things and probably will still be cleaning in some of the days to come.! Therefore, my next apology is to my blog site, 2015, I am sorry. This is the outlet God has given me to share with the world that they are not alone in their mess and mistakes, trials and tribulations (1 Peter 5:9). That yes, even Christians have battles that are really hard, challenging, and demanding, struggles that are too real to take on and break away from, that yes, some days we don't feel like putting on the whole armor of God, we only wanna put on partial armor, some days we want to be childish instead of putting those childish things away like we should because we became men an women, and that yes, even Christians sometimes entertain the devil a little longer than we know we should because although we know the word and God has better, the fruit on the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil is shinning some bright and our mouths are salivating, stomach is growling, and God is taking "longer than we like" with our meal to feed us, knowing that He is ALWAYS on time and that man shall not live on bread alone! (Matt 4:4) So to my blog site, and in essence, to myself and my followers, I am truly sorry! I'm not perfect and that's still no excuse! However, when you KNOW better, you DO better and 2016 is all about the better!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To the God of 2015, Jesus, and Holy Spirit, I am sorry! God, I have neglected You and used You as if you were my sugar daddy only coming to You when I was in need and thanked You mostly when You provided, Jesus, I have not exhibited Your light to the world and lifted Your name high so that men can be drawn to You and I have neglected Your sheep and not fed them, Holy Spirit, I have blatantly ignored You and went against Your instructions and directions countless times and suppressed You when it was Your time to rise up and show out and I never repented to any of You for it. For that, and more, I am sorry!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">2015 has shown me great things, both good and bad, and although I am sorry for some, heck, let me go ahead and say MOST of my actions towards those things, I am also sorry that I'm not sorry I have learned from them. Had it not been for straight up conviction and counseling, I would not be at this place I'm in now and back blogging! It goes to show you Romans 8:28: "<em>And we know that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ALL</strong></span> things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are called according to His purpose.</em>" The Bible is real y'all! Alive and breathing real!!! Had I not been acting out, disobedient, ignorant, or what have you, I wouldn't have been called out and challenged to change and me blogging and apologizing is a step. As a matter of fact, its step one: confessing and repenting. I KNOW that I love God and I KNOW that I am called, so therefore I KNOW that 2015, not only worked for my good, but is working, and will still BE working for my good even in 2016! Ha! How you like them "apples" Satan!? I know you don't, but WHO CARES!?!?!?!?! So for my last apology::</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>I am sorry that I'm back, and not only back but, BACK LIKE NEVER BEFORE!!!!!</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Pow!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Hello 2016...</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">-DanikaKayelle
XOXO</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">... Anything "2015" you need to say "I'm sorry" to??? Please feel free to share and do so. We all have things we need to apologize for, whether they're good or bad.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[My, God is good... No, let me rephrase that. MY God is good!!! Lord, You are SO amazing!! Praise Your Name Lord!!
So as I am settling into my new life, I have been searching, seeking, thinking, wondering, and asking God what should I share with His people? Should I share about my journey down the aisle? (I got married January 16, 2016 #UNASHAMED) Should I share how life has been thus far as a wife and newlywed?? (Pretty awesomely amazing might I add!) What should I share with Your people Lord!? This is what I have. This blog is for you and for me.

As I stated, I have been searching, seeking, thinking, wondering, and asking God what should I share with His people and in doing all that, I have been reading other blogs, the Bible, praying, observing things and others around me, and just scrolling on Facebook and Instagram and the message I got was "Just Do It". There's this song by KB called "Ima Just Do It" and I like jamming to it, but now it has a whole different meaning to me now. One of my dear friends' blog has inspired me in many ways, along with some convictions and confirmations along the way (you can check it out <a href="http://www.christalcasby.com">here)</a> along with the start of My Morning Grind, which is a coffee shop at my church that one of the Ministers opened up being obedient to God, and just seeing other people doing their thing from barbers, makeup artists, singers, rappers, poets, artists, stylists, etc.! I found myself saying, "They are doing the darn thing, like man! I can do the same thing!", and then it hit me!! IMA JUST DO IT!!!!

I'm going to bring it to a Biblical aspect now just how the Lord has placed it in me. He reminded me of the story of David and Goliath (1 Samuel 17). This story can be taken in so many different ways, depending on what you are facing, but today, for the sake of this blog, I'm coming from being like David. You see, Goliath was this giant that had the people of Israel afraid. In other words, Goliath is the thing standing in our way; whether that's fear, insecurities, lack of resources, doubt, worry, or whatever else it may be that is stopping us from just doing "it", whatever it is that we are supposed to be doing. But I am here to call out the David within us all! Goliath was bout that life, he knew within himself that no one could take him and went to share that with the people of Israel stating if they were to kill him, then the Philistines would be the Israelites' servants, however, if Goliath killed the man Israel sent, then Israel had to be the Philistines' servants (vs 8&amp;9) and the Bible says in verse 11 that when Saul, the king, and all of Israel heard, they were "dismayed and greatly afraid". How many of us can admit that when fear and doubt stands before us and speak up we get afraid??? No worries, I'll raise my hand first. Oh but David!!
<p style="text-align: left;">David was the youngest son of Jesse and he was also a shepherd boy who watched over the sheep. Well, Jesse sent David on a mission to go to his brothers who were at battle, but little did Jesse know, he was setting David up for victory! That is what I'm praying this blog do for you today; set you up for victory! David followed orders, went to his brothers in battle and heard the boast of Goliath and saw the people were afraid. Bruh! I really wanna be like David. David, without a doubt in his whole entire being asked, "For who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?" (v26) In other words, David asked, "Who is this fool talking smack thinking he can take down God and His people?!" I could only imagine the looks on the people faces who heard him ask that! But peep game! One of David's older brother who was at battle (Eliab) got mad when he heard David speak up.<span style="color: #993300;"><strong>
</strong></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>**NOTE:: It's possible that those close around you wont like it when you step up and speak out, just like its possible that those (believers) you think are fighting with you and for you are not**</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">But guess what you gotta do!? Shrug it off and say: "IMA JUST DO IT!" just like David did in verse 29-32. Here's the kicker and test though! Soon after you say "Ima just do it", discouragement will try to come in and deter you. Soon as David told Saul not to worry, he is gong to kill Goliath, Saul tells him in verse 33: "<em>You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him; for you are a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.</em>" Let me throw you another nugget::</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ffcc00;"><strong>1 Timothy 4:12 says "<em>Let <del>no one</del> despise your youth, but be an example to the believers in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">word</span>, in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">conduct</span>, in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">love</span>, in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">spirit</span>, in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">faith</span>, in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">purity</span></em>" also, it does not matter if someone is a "<del>veteran</del>" in the thing that you are called to do; if God called you to it, He has purposed you to do it! (Jeremiah 29:11) PLUS! If God is for you, <del>WHO can be against you</del>!? (Rom 8:31) </strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">I'm giving y'all some good bible here, imjussayn! Now back to the story::</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Regardless of what YOU think your circumstance(s) is/are, you, I, <strong>WE</strong> need to be like David! We need to speak back to the Goliaths, Eliabs, and Sauls in our lives and let them know who WE are and WHOSE WE ARE! David gave some background on who he was, what he did, and ended it with some red velvet cupcakes by stating: "<em>The Lord, who delivered me form the paw of the lion and the paw of the bear, He will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.</em>" Man! Talk about full blown confidence and Godly cockiness!!! Lord, give me that of David please!!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now for the sake of text:: <span style="color: #800000;"><strong>People are going to try and dress you for battle in what they THINK you need to be dressed in, but we have to continue to be like David and KNOW that just what we need is already with us (vs38-40) and peep this!</strong> <span style="color: #000000;">**</span><span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It may not even be big or elaborate, but something as small and simple as 5 smooth stones and a</strong></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: underline;"><strong> sling!!!</strong></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>**</strong></span> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So don't fret. What you have to just do it, if God has placed it in you, it will get the job done! Don't let Eliabs, Saul, and Goliath (emotions, insecurities, jealousy, fear, or whatever else) stand in the way; dismiss that and load up that slingshot and aim straight at the forehead! Okay!? Okay. Now let us go forth and &gt;&gt;NIKE&lt;&lt;. ;)</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[WRONG!!!

So this morning as I was driving, the song "Heaven" by Mary Mary came on and walaa, here I am!!! The song says, "I got to get myself together cuz I got somewhere to go, and I'm praying when I get there, I'll see everyone I know"; then I had another thought, or maybe more like a flashback. It was &lt;maybe, sorta, kinda&gt; a <del>rude thought</del>, but I thought about social media and posts people put for persons who perish. It seems that every time a person die, it NEVER FAILS that at the end of each post or underneath every picture its, "Heaven has gained another angel", "Rest in Heaven", or even "See you when I get there"; and so my thought:: "Really?!? You really think so?!" I mean, truth be told,
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>ALL ROADS <del>DO NOT LEAD</del> TO HEAVEN!!</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">I mean, it's the ugly and harsh truth. It would be TOTALLY nice if everyone can get into Heaven, but that is just not the dealio! In John chapter 3, Jesus comes across a man named Nicodemus and Jesus tells Nicodemus a very key component regarding seeing the Kingdom of God. Jesus says in verse 3 (I'm reading NKJV*), "<em>Most assuredly</em> (surely), <em>I say to you, UNLESS one is BORN AGAIN, he</em> (or she)<em> cannot see the Kingdom of God</em>", emphasis added. Here we see the first step. One must be born again. I chuckled a bit at Nicodemus' come back question (v4) because it shows how simple minded and ignorant (simply meaning "lack of knowledge") us humans can be, but at the same time, how sincere and innocent we can be at times. Nicodemus asks, (and I'm paraphrasing), "Born again?! How is that possible!? Can I go back into my mother's womb and be born again?!" ::Confession:: Sometimes I do tend to jump to conclusion and for a second I thought Nicodemus was trying to be smart, but he really wasn't..okay, let's keep going.:: Jesus, oh so patient and tolerable Jesus, answers him and tell him what He means by being born again; "<em>Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the Kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the</em> Spirit<em> is spirit.</em>" (John 3: 5-6) Simple right?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So here we have step numero uno, but catch the teas!!! "One must be born again to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SEE</strong></span> the Kingdom of God!" "What!?" you may be thinking, "Just to see!? Man! How can I get IN!?" Well, let us continue...one must be born of water and the Spirit to enter, but furthermore...</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">1 Corinthians 6:9 and 10 says: "<em>Do you NOT know that the UNRIGHTEOUS will NOT inherit the Kingdom of God? Do NOT be deceived. Neither FORNICATORS, nor IDOLATERS, nor ADULTERERS, nor HOMOSEXUALS, nor SODOMITES, nor THEIVES, nor COVETOUS, nor DRUNKARDS, nor REVILERS, nor EXTORTIONERS will inherit the Kingdom of God" </em>(emphasis added). I also looked at another translation, the New Living Translation says, "<em>Don't you realize that those who do wrong will not inherit the Kingdom of God? Don't fool yourself. Those who indulge in sexual sin, or who worship idols, or commit adultery, or are male prostitutes, or practice homosexuality, or are thieves, or greedy people, or drunkards, or are abusive, or cheat people---NONE OF THESE WILL INHERIT THE KINGDOM OF GOD"</em> (emphasis added). So answer me again, We all going to Heaven??? Let us not be foolish.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Talk about cut and dry huh!?!? Yeesh!! I don't know about you, but I know a few people that fall into quite a few of those categories and I love how verse 11 come in that thing smoothly (you know, like that beat), it says: (and I'm still in NLT) "<em>Some of you were once like that. But you were cleansed; you were made holy; you were made right with God by calling on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God." </em>Which is so true and brings us back to the first principle of being born again!!! But did you catch the "some"? Not everyone who's born again had those types of backgrounds, so it really doesn't matter where you came from, what matters is where you are NOW?!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So you want to get to Heaven eh? Well, are you born again?! Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior and believe He died in our place and rose again on the third day with ALL (not some) power in His hands!? Yeah?? Well, how are you living? Are you still sexually impure, putting other things and people before God, stealing, practicing and living in homosexuality, abusing people verbally or physically, cheating, etc.?! Because guess what?! That being "born again" may allow you "SEE" the Kingdom of God, but those actions...unh unh, will NOT allow you to INHERIT the Kingdom boo boo.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Well what can we conclude here?? We can conclude that nah, all roads do not lead to Heaven. As a matter of fact, there's only one road that leads to Heaven and its very narrow and difficult to where only a few ever find it; however the highway to hell is broad and wide, easily accessible for the many who choose to go that way (Matthew 7:13&amp;14 for reference)! So we see its a choice whether or not you go to Heaven or Hell. God gave us the blueprint and instructions on how to get in, it's up to us on how we build. I mean, I know we not gon stop saying things like "See you when I get there" cuz it's just EASIER to believe that; however it is my prayer that we start standing on the Word and letting the Word be right and all else be wrong (Romans 3:4), because at the end of your life; you're gonna wish you and others had done things right.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Bless and Be Blessed

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Maaaaannn!!! Now I may be telling my age here, but y'all remember saying that back in the gap right before you have a dance contest.?! They had hand movements to go to it and everything!!!! Memories, I tell ya.. Some are still good to have. Anywho!! I guess God is calling me out to dance. No really, God is calling me out. He made His move, shook some things up and now it is my turn...oh Jesus! Help Lord!!

Okay, so this month in church we are focusing on Faith. What is faith? The people of faith. And we are being challenged to "<em>walk by faith and not by sight</em>" (2 Corinthians 5:7). Normally I don't blog about things like this, so this must be meaningful and needed not only for myself, but for you as well.

I wrote a blog previously called "Stepping out on faith:: Walk or Sink" (you can go read it <a href="http://danikakayelle.com/stepping-out-on-faith-walk-or-sink/">here</a>). I'm mentioning it because the Lord led me to read the blog again yesterday and I remembered why I was called to the place I am now and why God calls us out of familiar places and places us in a "foreign land" so to say. &gt;Say it with me:: That's Faith!&lt; Every other Wednesday at my church we have PULSE, which is our youth ministry, and I have been blessed to be one of the leaders and I speak just about every Wednesday. Now this past Wednesday was the first Wed since like, idk, September/October, I was actually comfortable speaking. It was weird, yet rewarding all at the same time. Well, this particular night, can you guess what we spoke on?? Yep! Faith, that's right!! And at the end, I challenged everyone to find a verse personal to them to stand on and declare, decree, and confess that thing of faith, through faith, and with faith unto God! Now this is what brings me here. I prayed on what my verse would be and ...well, ima just post it here...
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">"<em>And He said to them, 'Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who does not believe will be condemned. And these signs will follow those who believe: In My Name they will cast out demons; they will speak with new tongues; they will take up serpents; and if they drink anything deadly, it will not by no means hurt them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover.' So then, after the Lord had spoken to them, He was received up into Heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God. And they went out and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them and confirming the word through the accompanying signs. Amen." </em>Mark 16:15-20, NKJV</p>
</blockquote>
Bruh! Talk about that drove!! No, really! I was looking for something more, Psalms 37 or Proverbs 2, you know, something along those lines; but how many of you know His thoughts are not our thoughts?! Neither are His ways our ways?!? (That's in Isaiah if you wanted a reference) So pow!! The Lord has OFFICIALLY called me out! Those verses in Mark chapter 16 are called "The Great Commission". WHAT!?! Let me break this down for you. The word "great" is defined "of an extent, amount, or intensity considerably ABOVE the normal or average", "of ability, quality, or eminence considerably ABOVE the normal or average", and/or "denoting the element of something that is the MOST IMPORTANT or the MOST WORTHY of consideration" and the word "commission" means "an instruction, command, or DUTY given to a person or group of people." Do you not see the call out!? This verse is for all of us as believers, but this verse is specifically for me and God wants me to do my dance man!

So you mean to tell me God is instructing, commanding, and giving me a duty to do ABOVE the normal or average that is most important and most worthy of consideration!? Yep!! That is exactly what He is doing. God is calling me out to consider (which really means DO) going into ALL the world, not just some or the ones I'm familiar with or the ones I want to go to or think I need to go to (Can't be like Jonah), and preach the gospel (His Word) to EVERY creature, saved, unsaved, dogs, cats, Free Willy, ABOVE the normal or average! Who was ready for this!? Not she!! But you want to know the greatest and most comforting thing of it all, is that when the disciples went out and preached (in other words, when they followed orders and obeyed), the Lord was working with them and confirming His words through them by the accompanying signs He said would happen. That's great right?!
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Lord calls you out and when you go to do your thing, He doesn't leave you out to dance on your own, but He dances with you!!! </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">This Guy! Such a gentleman!!! :)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Well, now its your turn! I am calling you out! Yep! I challenge you to get before the Lord and seek what it is you need to be standing on and doing and when He tells you (cuz He will!); I NEED YOU TO DO IT!!! (Checkout my blog <a href="http://danikakayelle.com/checkmate/">Checkmate</a> which speaks about just doing it). Then, if you don't mind, come back here and share it with the people! I know I, for one, would love to hear about God speaking and moving in your life, so please...don't be shy! I will be looking forward to rejoicing with you!!!!</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[ALL ABOARD!!!!
SN: I have never seen that show, not that it matters anyways... ANYWHO!!!
<blockquote>"<em>Love suffers long <span style="text-decoration: underline;">AND</span> is kind; love does not envy; love does not parade itself, is not puffed up; does not behave rudely, does not seek its own, is not provoked, thinks no evil; does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth; bears all thing, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all thing. Love never fails..." </em>1 Corinthians 13:4-8(beginning), NKJV. **emphasis added**</blockquote>
Love. Love. Love. (In my Florida Evans voice) Bruh! In my devotional time just now I got hit, slammed, pushed, shoved, told off, and slapped with SOOOOOO many things it ain't even funny! I was gonna say ambushed too, but the truth of the matter is I already knew the things I was getting hit with, so it wasn't no real surprise, but it was a definitely reality check.

My life right now, if I am to be honest, is a mess. And it IS a mess because I am not walking the Godly principles! The Bible is the main ingredient to EVERY pot, to every meal, to every homework assignment, to every test, to ever-ree-THANG and if we put that into everything, then everything will surely come out good to the bone; finger licking good!! YUM!

God knows exactly where we are every step of the way and He is with us whether we "feel" Him or not. Think about Israel in the wilderness. God was RIGHT there and if I'm not mistaken, He is the SAME God, "<em>who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty" </em>(Revelation 1:8; latter); so this tells me He is doing the same thing today! And God will meet you RIGHT where you are; whether its in the wilderness or the Promise Land... So you're ready for this?! Well, here we go!!!!
<ol>
	<li><em><strong>Love suffers long and is kind.</strong></em> (You may also see in other versions "patient and kind")</li>
</ol>
Well, let us back up and stay docked for a quick second for the stragglers to catch up. Prior to verse 4, the first 3 verses of 1 Corinthians speaks on how regardless of what you do: speak with tongues of men and angels, prophesy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, have faith to remove mountains, bestow all your goods and give, and/or even give your body to be burned; NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO, if you do it <del>without love</del>; you are NOTHING and it profits you <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><del>NOTHING</del></strong></span>! In other words, it don't even make sense for you to do those things because guess what, like The Rock used to say, "<span style="color: #ffff00;"><strong>It does not matter!</strong></span>" Now let's roll...

Love suffers long and is kind. NO matter HOW many times a person does not get something right, no matter how many times you ask for something and never get it, no matter how many times you pray and do not obtain, love keeps on going...and guess what!? <strong>It keeps on going with a smile on its face</strong>. How fun and easy is that?! Ha!! Tis not! We cannot say we love and then get mad when we do something and get nothing in return. It does not work that way...but we will get back to that in a few.
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2.<em><strong> Love does not envy.</strong></em></p>
We all know envy means to be/feel jealous (i.e. wanting what someone else has), but let's get technical because I am, as my husband would call me, "Technical Tammy"! The word "envy" can be defined as "a feeling of discontented or resentful longing aroused by someone else's possessions, qualities, or luck". So bam! Love does not envy, but love loves what it has! Love doesn't look at another couple and say, "Man, I wish I had that" (#Relationshipgoals), or "Her husband does that, boy that's nice, if only my husband would", or "If only I had the platform of (whomever is doing what you desire to do), then my life would be so much better than this", you get the drift... Love suffers long and is kind regardless of what the next person may or may not have...cuz guess what!? You don't know the whole story of what you are looking to! You may not really want that...imjussayn. **shrugs**
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3. <em><strong>Love does not parade itself, is not puffed up.</strong></em></p>
Bruh! Love is not bragging on yourself!! Shut up and go satdown somewhere! Because like I said before under numero uno, it doesn't matter what you do or how many times you do something, because if you were doing it out of love, then you don't have to go brag about it... You're just going to do it, with a smile, and chillax. You may have to suffer long, but at least you know its "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">love</span>" that you're doing it for and ima just go on ahead and throw this lil nugget out there and pray you catch the correlation... God is "LOVE" and you ARE doing it for "love", right.!? (That's Bible, look it up).
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">4. <em><strong>Love does not behave rudely!</strong></em></p>
Bruh! This the one I kept getting hit with in my devotional!! I was having so many flashback moments of me huffing and puffing while doing something or rolling my eyes while serving, Man! Yall! Danika! <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><del><strong>THAT IS NOT LOVE!</strong></del></span><del></del> Love is kind, love smiles; love don't smack their lips when they get asked a question or stomp their feet and slam the doors because it didn't get what it wants. Which brings us to 5.
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">5. <em><strong>Love does not seek its own</strong></em>.</p>
It is NOT about you!! We must <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ALWAYS</strong></span> remember that! If you're doing it out of love, it is for the other person anyways, so tell me... Where do YOU come in at?! No worries, I'll wait............
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">6. <em><strong>Love is not provoked and thinks no evil.</strong></em></p>
Haha!! I had to laugh at this one because it was another slap in the face!!! We all have said (or thought), "Well, they ain't acting right, why should I?!", or something along those lines. I'm about to answer you. You should because YOU LOVE! Or....maybe you don't and that's why you're provoked and think evil. Ouch. That wasn't me, Spirit just said that! But it's the truth and you can't even argue with that! Tuh. Moving along...
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">7. <strong><em>Love does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth.</em></strong></p>
How many of y'all, when you're mad at your spouse or what have you, get a kick out of something going sour/bad for them??? It's okay, that's what we are here for!! We can't do that! I know, we're human, BUT <strong>we gotta stop using that as an excuse people!!</strong> Philippians 2:5 says, "<em>Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus"</em>. You think Jesus is excited when bad things happen to us?! <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><del><strong>NO!</strong></del></span> He wants the best for us. WHY?! Because <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>HE LOVES US!</strong></span></em> Rejoice in that; the truth. Rejoice in the fact that "though they slay you" (or your spouse/relative/friend/enemy), consider it pure and count it all joy when you and/or your spouse, friend, coworker, whoever are going through, keep in mind that <strong>ALL things</strong> are working for your good and that what the devil meant for harm....you know the rest!
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">8. (This one is where I began to cry) <em><strong>Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love. Never. FAILS!</strong></em></p>
No matter what, no matter the circumstance, no matter the situation; love hangs in there. Love is strong man! To bear, to believe, to hope, to endure; PERIOD! That is not contingent on the other entity. That is just is. Nothing more, nothing less...just is. Is bearing, is believing, is hoping, is enduring; is. That's some real deep stuff and if that wasn't enough; IT NEVER FAILS!! My God! Time to port...

Now, as we made it to the end of our destination and you get off the boat, here is the task from this day forward: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Let us work on love.</strong></span> That last part, "<em>love never fails</em>" tells me that regardless if I am to suffer long, or ain't getting what I "think" I deserve, or feeling some type of way, or giving and not getting anything in return, that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>LOVE NEVER FAILS!</strong></span> I will, you will, as long as we are loving, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">sincerely</span>, will reap; WHY!? Because you reap what you sow and God LOVES a cheerful giver! So continue to bear, continue to believe, continue to hope, and continue to endure; because by doing all those things listed above, you will ALWAYS win and come out on top!!!

Go on and love somebody. THE REAL WAY!

Bless and Be Blessed.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Hola!! Sooooo, I've been sitting on this for a lil minute, but I think now is the time for it to come out.

A few weeks, maybe a month or so ago, the Holy Spirit asked me if I was a "wife" or "wifey"?, and in my head, I was like "Ain't that the same thing?!"; but then I figured since He asked me that, it couldn't have been. So I thought about it and I just sat on it. So now, today, I am getting up and going to answer this.

I AM a WIFE. Period. And I am striving to not only be a wife, but to be a virtuous wife! Because according to Proverbs 31:10, we see that she is<em> <strong>rare</strong> </em>and<em> <del>not easily found</del></em>; so that is my goal!

A wife simply just mean "a married woman, the woman someone is married to; a woman joined to another person in marriage, the female spouse" according to Merriam-Webster and freedictionary.com; and yes, that is I, but the Bible defines "wife" as so much more and THAT is the wife I am and striving to be!

I didn't like the terms "hubby" and "wifey" even before I got married, but after I got married I was definitely not feeling them! Granted, my husband is not really the type of guy who would call me his wifey anyways, so that is great; however, if he was, we would have had to have a little conversation. Now I already know what you about to say, "Here she go about to be all technical" (I told yall my husband calls me "Technical Tammy"!), buuuuuuuut the term "wifey" is a worldly term and not a Biblical one! Please tell me what version of the Bible you saw it in? No worries, I'll give you time to Google it.

Satan duplicates God, that his thing, so there is no surprise he's getting you girls all amped up and excited about being some dude's "wifey"! Girl, please!! That is NOT ::Hashtag:: Goals! I found this to be interesting though: when I searched the term "wifey" the first thing that popped up said that it is a "condescending way to referring to a man's wife", yet so many "wives" loves when their man calls them that! Hmmmm... So then, I continued my research on Urbandictionary.com and guess what!? To my (not) surprise, wifey doesn't mean that you are actually someone's wife!!! **GASP** Haha!! I'm sorry, but I really had to laugh! People bucked up about being called wifey missing the fact that they just may never actually become "WIFE".. Poor lil tink tinks. So let me get into it....

A wife is someone who is actually married! Legally, signed, sealed, delivered, and filed with the state you have been married in. (<em>NOTE:: WIVES! You have accomplished something some women are striving to accomplish, please stop degrading that and yourself by calling yourself "wifey" and being okay with being called "wifey"</em>). A wifey is a girlfriend or chick or boo that a guy just so happens likes <strong>above the rest</strong> and could <em>maybe, possibly</em> see himself marrying, BUT <del>that's not guarantee</del>. So my challenge is to get women who are married to become and <strong>BE</strong> a wife and not a wifey and to get ladies who are single to set a bar to become a wife and not settle for "<del>wifey</del>"! Which is why the Lord has placed a ministry in me called "<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I AM a W.I.F.E.</strong></span>" (<em>Wives Interceding For Eachother</em>). This ministry kicks off <strong>Saturday, April 30, 2016 at 3pm</strong>. The first meet will be at my church, <em>The Love of Jesus Ministry, 1905 Hwy 59, Mandeville, LA, 70448</em>. (It's really not that far of a drive, do not be discouraged). Here, we wives will come together and learn how to be and grow to be not <del>just a wife</del>, a married woman, the woman someone is married to; a woman joined to another person in marriage, the female spouse, but a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><em>VIRTUOUS WIFE</em></strong></span>! The rare and extremely worthy wife!

I believe that, yes, we, as wives, may have obtained the "good thing" ribbon/status (some of us at least), for the Bible says "<em>He who finds a wife finds a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">good thing</span>, and obtains favor from the Lord.</em>" (Proverbs 18:22); however, there is a difference between "good" and "virtuous" and since the "good thing" came first in chapter 18 of the book of Proverbs and the "virtuous" comes way later at the end of Proverbs in chapter 31 AND it asks "<em>Who can find a virtuous wife?</em>" tells me that "Yeah, your husband may have found a good thing in you, but there is still a search for the virtuous wife", and being as it's ways away from chapter 18 (13 chapters to be exact) further tells me that there is levels to this and there is work to be done!

So if you're okay with just being a wife and a "good thing", then great! That's an accomplishment! Your husband has obtained favor with the Lord and you can go on and continue on being a good thing! More power to you! However, if you desire for your children to rise up and call you blessed and for your husband to praise you, then take the virtuous challenge with me!! Meet me at the end of this month to begin a journey of a lifetime!! (Cuz it just may take that long to reach the virtuous level! lol) For those who can't make it, I may do live broadcasts on Periscope, or possibly YouTube, not quite sure yet, but if that IS your desire, to be a virtuous wife, and you're not from the area or have a way to meet me, just drop a comment and your email below and I will see to it that you embark upon this train with me and other like-minded wives who will intercede for each other because remember Amos 3:3 asks; "<em>Can two walk together, unless they are agreed?</em>". I can't do it without you, you can't do it without me, and we both can't do it without God!
<p style="text-align: left;">And to my singles, do not fret! You will not be left behind! Our journey is also for those who are to follow behind. Be on the lookout for future open meetings and a retreat that is to come later this year!!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">**<em>Tentatively </em><em>the end of October in either Alabama or Florida</em>**</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Also, meetings and outings will <strong>not always</strong> be on the Northshore, but are <em>planned</em> to be <strong>every month</strong> at the end of the month; so wives, <strong>you can plan ahead!!! </strong>Tell the husband, call the baby sitter, this is YOUR time! Don't miss out!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Bless and Be Blessed!
-DanikaKayelle, XOXO</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't we just looove Trump?! Haha!! So, funny thing happened today (and that's not a serious question by the way); I GOT FIRED!!! Ha! Yep, so true! Okay, maybe that's not so funny, but its really hilarious to me; but let me explain why! The reason is not because I hated my job, which I did, (well, it was more so some of the people and the atmosphere than the actual job that I hated), but it was because of the "secret prayers" I had been praying that makes it a joyous occasion! About a week or so ago, I did something ugly and ungodly at work. When the supervisor came in a room I was in, I turned my back on her; which was rude, I will admit, and then that same Friday, the Lord got with me and I repented to Him for my actions and I made it in my mind that I was going to apologize to her for my behavior and move forward. That Monday I did, however, in the midst of our conversation, I pretty much set the record that when she and I were to speak, it would be business related and nothing else...needless to say, I'm sure that already got me kicked out of the door (premeditated-ly)! Well, I don't feel like I've done anything wrong, because I didn't want to lead her on or give her false hope or what-have you and plus, I just can't be fake. Like why?! God says, if you do something and its not out of love, there's pretty much no reason to do it (1 Cor 13:1-3) ! Now don't get me wrong, I DO still need to grow and be groomed more in that area because I can't just cut people off or shut them out just because I don't personally care for them; <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>THAT IS NOT LIKE <del>CHRIST</del> EITHER</strong></span>, but I can honestly say that God has started changing my heart. From that moment on, I had to change my view on waking up every morning and going into that establishment, and I did. I literally found my joy in the Lord and started doing more in my position, so I am excited and feel good, within myself, how I left and how it all went down!

I mentioned to a few people who knew what was going on at the job that I wasn't going to quit, but that Jesus would have to allow them to fire me and since my attitude was changing, I really wasn't worrying about them firing me or not. On Facebook, I try to post a "Song of the Day" every day and I was scrolling down my timeline and recognized the songs He has been giving me. Songs like, "I am Healed", "My name is Victory" "Worth fighting For", "Because He Lives", "Victory is Mine", and this morning (which I loved) the #SOTD was "The Lord is Blessing me, right now!" So yeah, needless to say, I think God has been preparing me for this termination and I praise Him for it!!

This job was a blessing and it served its role. I try to look for God in every situation, so when the "nitpicking" started happening, way prior to me turning my back on her, I started praying and asking why am I there and what am I to do and/or get out of being there. Well, one! The job came right when I needed it. I received a grant from school and right after I got married, my grant money was pretty much gone, so I started praying for employment to help take the load off of my husband, and walaa, I got the call for an interview I believe 3 days after we got married. I was in my last semester of Grad School (Graduation Saturday, May 7th!) and had to find an internship to go with work and the grant I received, and the Lord blessed me with that! Then! I wasn't even supposed to get this job because the supervisor wanted to hire someone else, but how many of you know <strong>WHAT GOD HAS FOR YOU...?!</strong> Well, anyways, so this job served its purpose to assist me and my husband with funds and insurance. We were able to get some health stuff taken care of because of so and save a little bit of money and pay some stuff off. Next, I met a beautiful young lady who I believe God has set in my path for a reason and had I not gotten that job, I never would have met her along with some awesome residents whom today I got to share a lot of stories and laughs with before I was "unfortunately terminated"!  Lastly, I found joy in the Lord in the midst of my hard times! Y'all waking up EVERY morning 5 days a week KNOWING I was to go there was <strong>TORTURE!!!!</strong> But after that Friday, my attitude started to change, and this past week and the days leading up today, I can see how God has been setting me up.

I'm writing this blog mostly for my own personal encouragement, especially in the future. When you begin to walk in purpose and faith, the enemy will try to take you off that road and deter you from continuing on. You see, I'm not pressed about finding a job, because I believe my life is a ministry and ministry is what will be paying me; however, I'm also not opposed to working, BUT only if that is where God wants me to be. I am to a point to where if it ain't God, then I don't want it. I was reminded and encouraged in the Lord of Moses and to be honest with you, I don't know why he was brought to mind. Now as I think on his story, I can see why. Moses done something that was ungodly, he killed a man and then he fled to Midian (I turned my back on the supervisor and then fled to God). There in Midian, he was tending to the sheep when the Lord came to Him in a burning bush (I began doing more at work and God has been coming to me through songs in my heart). In that moment with the Lord, Moses was pretty much terminated from tending to sheep so he can go and deliver the Israelite from hands of the Egyptian (I was fired!). This is where I am encourage! My secret prayers (which are not so secret anymore) has been to go out like Jesus into the world and bring forth deliverance through Jesus to those in bondage and to dive and do more in ministry! I couldn't do that with a 8-4:30! Well, I could have, but it just would have been a little more challenging; however my heart wasn't there, and although I was gonna hang in there (until I got fired or another opportunity presented itself), it really didn't make sense (remember what we said earlier about doing things without love?! THERE'S NO POINT!). I mean, I not excited about getting fired, but I am excited about God answering my prayers and taking me out of a place that really wasn't purposeful and bringing me to a place of walking in purpose!

So to end this, for myself, and whoever else may be facing a termination of some sort, remember the words God told Moses. He said, "<em>I will be with you. And this will be the sign to you that it is I who have sent you: When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you will worship God on this mountain</em>" (Exodus 3:12); focusing on "WHEN YOU HAVE".... When God calls you out and sends you forth, not only is He with you, but there's a <strong>guarantee</strong> that it will be done and you will see that it has been Him ("<em>this will be the sign that it is I</em>"), and you will "<em>worship God</em>"! Hallelujah!

Stay encourage...an ending is only a beginning. If you need more reading on that, click <a href="http://danikakayelle.com/ending-beginnings/">&gt;here&lt;</a>, which is even more encouraging to me as it talks about walking away from my job 3 years ago!! God is amazing y'all! **I ain't supposed to be punching no clock!** &lt;&lt;&lt;Speaking it!&lt;&lt;&lt; Time to get this Kingdom work done! I ain't got no more excuses now. Tuh! Lol...

Bless and Be Blessed
