INSERT INTO "blogs" VALUES(1,'You''re Fired','<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Destiny</span> is the inevitable or necessary fate to which a particular person 0r thing is destined. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose</span> is the reason for which something''s is done or created or&nbsp;for which something exists. A <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Gift</span> is a notable capacity, talent, or endowment; something voluntarily transferred by one person&nbsp;to another without compensation. You see, everyone was created with a purposed gift to bring about their&nbsp;destiny. Destiny is&nbsp;inevitable.&nbsp;It is a necessary&nbsp;fate. In other words, destiny is something&nbsp;you cannot&nbsp;escape. Whatever God has&nbsp;for you&nbsp;is for you. You can''t change that, give it back, nor negotiate that.&nbsp;And better yet, can''t&nbsp;no man take that from you. If you are a child of God, you were preDESTINED, you were called, you were justified, and you were glorified. (Romans 8: 29-30). So don''t be afraid or run from your destiny. It''s yours for the taking. You were called for that, you were justified for that, and God has glorified you to do that. So do it! Purpose is the reason something was done or created.&nbsp;God creating you was not a mistake, no matter what your mom or dad has said. You were DESTINED to be created. Embrace it. You were PURPOSELY created. Everything and everyone has a purpose. So really and truly, there are no mistakes.&nbsp;But in all honesty, God loves "mistakes" It doesn''t say that He heals the non-broken, He heals the broken, He heals the sick!&nbsp;Jesus tell&nbsp;us in Matthews 11:28-29 (KJV)&nbsp;Come unto me all ye that labour and are heave laden, and I will give you rest. Take my&nbsp;yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. He don''t ask for people that&nbsp;"got it all together" to come to Him. He don''t need you. You got it, so what is it that He can do for you?? That''s why I believe God chooses the "mistaken", the broken hearted, the ones with a past, the ones who were told they will never amount to anything, those that were tore down by the ones that should have been lifting them up, those that was told they are going to&nbsp;end up&nbsp;either dead or in jail. THOSE are the ones that shine brighter than those&nbsp;always seen. If all&nbsp;dogs&nbsp;can bark, then no one will be surprised at the next dog that barks,&nbsp;but now if dog meows, then that&nbsp;dog is more likely to turn more heads than the "normal" dog. Can we all say that&nbsp;often times its best to be different!?&nbsp;Why be the same??? Especially if everybody are doing the same things!? A gift&nbsp;is a notable capacity, talent,&nbsp;OR endowment. So don''t think just because you can''t sing, dance, write, or what have you that God made you giftless. The conjunction "or"&nbsp; is used to connect words, phrases, or clauses representing alternatives or used in correlation. Meaning, in order to be considered having a gift does not&nbsp;requires you having all three. If that was the case, there would have been "and" where the "or" was placed. You don''t necessarily have to have a "talent" to bless God and others with your gift. For instance, notable capacity. Your gift could be the ability or power to do, experience, or understand something worthy of attention or notice;&nbsp;to&nbsp;recognize something in somebody to focus on to help bring out the good and better in them or to realize&nbsp;that someone is hurting on the inside&nbsp;even when they are smiling on the outside. Being that person to lend a listening ear to those with a battered and broken heart that needs to speak. Or, on the other hand, you may not be a really good listener, nor do you have talent, but The Lord has blessed you with financial blessings. That''s where endowment comes into place. Your gift can be simply purchasing books for the not so privilege child who is determined to bettering him/herself but the world or "system" seems to be against them and even though they are trying and doing the right things, they still fall short, or if you can''t cook, it can be purchasing can goods and/or non perishable items to give to the needy and homeless. A gift is so wide range and I think that''s where a lot of us gets confused, scared, or nervous about. Your gift may not be as "flashy", "extravagant", or whatevs as the next, but your gift is your gift! Not to compare to others, but to share with others.&nbsp;1 Corinthians 12:4 (KJV) says: Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. 1&nbsp; Corinthians 7:7 (NET) says: I wish that everyone was as I am. But each has his own gift from God, one this way, another that. And then Roman 6:12 (KJV) says: Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith. From all three of these verses, we can see that everyone has their own gift and Romans tells us to act accordingly to those gifts to the proportion of our faith. Meaning, your gifts will and shall reflect your faith. If you don''t have faith that if you sow bountifully then you shall&nbsp;reap bountifully, then 9xs out of 10, your gift wont be of monetary things. But 1Peter 4:10-11 tells us to use our gifts to serve one&nbsp;another as&nbsp;good stewards of the varied&nbsp;grace of&nbsp;God.&nbsp;V11 (NET): Whosever speaks, let it be with&nbsp;God''s word. Whoever serves, do so with the strength that God supplies so&nbsp;that in everything God will be glorified through&nbsp;Jesus Christ...&nbsp;So at the end of it all, your gift is not to reap&nbsp;manly&nbsp;blessing, or to glorify man and/or uplift&nbsp;yourself,&nbsp;but they are to&nbsp;serve one&nbsp;another&nbsp;and to&nbsp;glorify The Father.&nbsp;It''s not about you, but its about&nbsp;Jesus. Romans 12:3 (KJV) tells us: For I say through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly the he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith. In other words, yes, think highly of yourself, be confident in your gifts and your works, but don''t pat yourself too hard on the back for God has only given you what''s equivalent to your faith. So I ask you, what is your faith level?! Now, I know I spent a lot of time going in on gifts because I feel that''s the thing that''s hindering some&nbsp;us from realizing our purpose and going into our destiny. You see, I&nbsp;been knew I had the gift of words since a child, but I never was fully comfortable in it because I felt I wasn''t as advanced as the next person who wrote poetry and I was as brave as the next person to share my words with others outside of my inner&nbsp;circle or those who I wrote pieces about or&nbsp;for.&nbsp;And then, I wasn''t really&nbsp;saved,&nbsp;even though I was baptized (yes, there is a difference),&nbsp;nor living right at all to fully use my gift or&nbsp;to know that&nbsp;the purpose of my gift was for my destiny.&nbsp;But don''t get me wrong, I am no where, shape, or form&nbsp;living completely right, and none of us&nbsp;ever will,&nbsp;but&nbsp;the&nbsp;difference now from then&nbsp;is when I slip up (and I do, I''m human), I&nbsp;go to&nbsp;God and admit my wrong(s), and wholeheartedly, not only ask for forgiveness, but repent (there is a difference), and move forward and not stay or dwell on that mistake. Therefore my spirit gets renewed and the conviction and guilt be removed; but that''s a whole nother blog for a totally different day. I am now to the point where&nbsp;I am ready to accept my gift, embrace my purpose, and work towards my destiny. After being told many, many times, by multiple different people, and receiving tons of confirmations over the last couple of days this blog was&nbsp;created. I don''t know what its going to do,&nbsp;where its going to go, or how it will be perceived or accepted, but&nbsp;what I do know that I am not doing it for&nbsp;me, those who told me&nbsp;I just need to go on&nbsp;ahead and start blogging, but I am&nbsp;doing it for Him.&nbsp;Also, I pray that this can reach, help, or touch somebody;&nbsp;whether its to confirm something they already knew, open their eyes to realize and see their gifts, purpose, and destiny, or touch them enough to decide its time to change and use their gifts for good&nbsp;rather than evil. As Philippians 4:17 (NET) says: I do not say this&nbsp;because I am seeking a&nbsp;gift. Rather, I seek&nbsp;the credit that&nbsp;abounds to your account. I&nbsp;don''t want any "amen"s or pats on the back for this; what I want is&nbsp;to use my gift and my story to glorify God and to motivate and uplift others so that they&nbsp;may prosper and grow and bless others. So, with that being said.....This is my gift&nbsp;from God to you.</p>','2016-05-18 03:58:34.891964','2016-05-21 01:26:51.977348','donald-trump-youre-fired.jpg','image/jpeg',32709,'2016-05-21 01:26:51.798975');
